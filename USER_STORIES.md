## High Priority

1. As a researcher, I want all biomedical articles to be stored with metadata  
   so that I can filter and retrieve documents efficiently.  

2. As a system, I want to split long articles into smaller chunks  
   so that searches are more precise and relevant.  

3. As a researcher, I want to ask a question in natural language  
   so that I can find semantically similar documents even if I don’t use exact keywords.  

4. As a system, I want to label a smaller set of 1,000 documents (Evaluation Core)  
   so that I can test whether the search and retrieval are correct.  

5. As a researcher, I want the system to return top-5 results with sources  
   so that I can trust the answers and verify the evidence.
