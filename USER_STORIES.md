# User Stories

- As a researcher, I want all biomedical articles to be stored with metadata so that I can filter and retrieve documents efficiently.

- As a system, I want to split long articles into smaller semantic chunks so that search results are more relevant.

- As a researcher, I want to cluster embedded document chunks, assign automatic labels, and generate natural-language queries from representative chunks so that the evaluation queries reflect the main biomedical subtopics.

- As a researcher, I want to query the system in natural language so that I can retrieve semantically related document chunks efficiently.

- As a researcher, I want the RAG system to generate concise, evidence-based answers so that I can understand key findings.

- As a system, I want to label and store an Evaluation Core of the documents so that retrieval can be tested.

- As a researcher, I want to measure recall, precision, and groundedness so that I can assess system quality.

- As a developer, I want to expose the system through FastAPI so that others can query it easily.

- As a researcher, I want to visualize retrieved sources and answers so that I can verify each claim.

- As a developer, I want to follow PEP 8 and PEP 257 so that code is maintainable.

- As a developer, I want to use pytest for integration and end-to-end testing so that pipelines are robust.

- As a developer, I want to track API usage and cost so that we stay within budget.

- As a project team, we want to finalize the documentation, poster, and presentation so that we can clearly communicate our results and demonstrate the system effectively.
