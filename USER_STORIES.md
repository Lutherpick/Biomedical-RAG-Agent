# User Stories

## High Priority

1. As a researcher, I want all biomedical articles to be stored with metadata  
   so that I can filter and retrieve documents efficiently.  

2. As a system, I want to split long articles into smaller chunks  
   so that searches are more precise and relevant.  

3. As a researcher, I want to ask a question in natural language  
   so that I can find semantically similar documents even if I don’t use exact keywords.  

4. As a system, I want to label a smaller set of 1,000 documents (Evaluation Core)  
   so that I can test whether the search and retrieval are correct.  

5. As a researcher, I want the system to return top-5 results with sources  
   so that I can trust the answers and verify the evidence.

## Lower Priority

6. As a developer, I want to follow PEP 8 and PEP 257 standards  
   so that the code is readable and maintainable.  

7. As a developer, I want automatic API docs generation  
   so that users can understand how to use the system easily.  

8. As a developer, I want to use pytest for integration and end-to-end tests  
   so that I can make sure workflows complete without errors.  

9. As a team, I want to track tasks in GitHub Projects  
   so that we can manage work without heavy tools like Jira.  

10. As a developer, I want to experiment with different biomedical prompt templates  
    so that the LLM provides more accurate and less hallucinated answers.  

11. As a researcher, I want to manually spot-check 10–15 queries  
    so that I can catch subtle issues the automated metrics might miss.
