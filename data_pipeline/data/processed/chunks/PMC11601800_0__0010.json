Ex - vivo culture of pyramidal cells from the model identified impaired dendritic excitability and action potential backpropagation even when haploinsufficiency was induced around P50 ( Spratt et al . , 2021 ) . Additionally , conditional deletion of Scn2a in either parvalbumin or somatostatin - positive interneurons did not appear to impair excitability in these neurons , which is consistent with previous findings ( Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ; Spratt et al . , 2019 ) . Utilizing Gabra6 - Cre , Nav1 . 2 has also been knocked down or deleted from cerebellar granule neurons ( C . Wang et al . , 2024 ) . Unlike the cerebrum , where Scn2a gets downregulated in adulthood , cerebellar granule neurons express Scn2a at high levels throughout life ( Gazina et al . , 2010 ) . When Scn2a was deleted in these cells using Gabra6 - Cre , mice displayed a hypersensitive vestibular ocular reflex ( VOR ) gain ( C . Wang et al . , 2024 ) . Interestingly , this parallels the VOR changes in humans with pathogenic SCN2A mutations ( Carson et al . , 2017 ; Sanders et al . , 2018 ; C . Wang et al . , 2024 ) . The change in VOR is likely due to alterations between cerebellar granule neurons and Purkinje cell synapses . Heterozygous loss of Nav1 . 2 is most likely reducing the high - frequency transmission between cerebellar granule neurons and Purkinje cells , which can disrupt synaptic plasticity by impairing long - term potentiation and thus altering VOR ( C . Wang et al . , 2024 ) . Although Nav1 . 2 is generally studied in neurons , it also functions in other nervous system cells . Gould & Kim , 2021 demonstrated that Nav1 . 2 is necessary for spiking activity and maturation of a subset of oligodendroglia in the brainstem and cerebellum ( Gould & Kim , 2021 ) . To discover this , a Scn2afl / f / Actin - Cre line was used to globally delete Scn2a in mice around P4 to P6 with tamoxifen injection ( Gould & Kim , 2021 ) . Deletion of Nav1 . 2 removed the subpopulation of spiking oligodendroglia but did not impact global oligodendroglia differentiation and maturation ( Gould & Kim , 2021 ) . Gould & Kim , 2021 also confirmed the presence of these Scn2a expressing oligodendroglia in the white matter of Olive baboons , a non - human primate ( Gould & Kim , 2021 ) . These data demonstrate that Nav1 . 2 plays an integral role in neuronal signaling and can impact the development of non - neuronal cells , which could explain the heterogeneous nature of the phenotypes seen in humans . Currently , only one SCN2A model primarily functions as a LOF mutation . This model emulates the human variant p . R102X , a premature stop codon at position 102 in the protein , which in humans has a dominant negative effect ( Kamiya et al . , 2004 ; Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . Scn2a R102X / + mice were identified as having absence - like seizures although appearing outwardly healthy , similar to the Planells - Cases Scn2a + / − model . At least one Scn2a R102X / + mouse was recorded using ECoG – EMG having a convulsive seizure ( Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) ."}
