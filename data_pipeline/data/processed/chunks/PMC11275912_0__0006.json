{"doc_id": "PMC11275912_0", "chunk_index": 6, "chunk_total": null, "text": "] - 2 , 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay was performed to determine the effect of compounds on the viability of HeLa ( ATCC - CRM - CCL2 ) , A549 ( CCL - 185 ) , SK - N - SH ( HTB - 11 ) cells and neonatal murine cardiomyocytes . Immortalized cells were washed twice with PBS , trypsinized , resuspended in GM , and plated in a 96 - well plate at a seeding density of 1 . 0 × 104 cells / well . When the cells attained approximately 70 % confluence , they were incubated with the indicated concentrations of C22 or C73 and kept at 37 ° C in 5 % CO2 for approximately 24 hours . Cells incubated with 1 % ( v / v ) DMSO alone served as negative controls . Final DMSO concentrations were kept below or at 1 % ( v / v ) . Post incubation , cells were washed once with sterile PBS . 10 μl of MTT solution ( 5 mg / ml in PBS ) was mixed with 100 μl PBS , added to the cells , which were further incubated at 37 ° C in 5 % CO2 for approximately 1 – 2 hours . The purple formazan crystals thus formed were dissolved in 100 μl of sterile DMSO , and the absorbance of the resulting mixture was measured using the Agilent BioTek Epoch 2 spectrophotometer at a sample wavelength of 540 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm . The Lethal Dose 50 ( LD50 ) values for C22 and C73 were determined by performing nonlinear regression analysis on the sigmoidal dose response curves obtained by fitting the data using GraphPad Prism ( version 9 . 3 . 1 , GraphPad Software ) . All experiments were carried out in triplicate . Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 106 A549 cells treated with 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) DMSO or 5 μM FICD inhibitors ( C22 or C73 ) for approximately 24 hours using an RNA miniprep kit ( Zymo Research ) and quantified using a NanoDrop ™ One Microvolume UV - Vis Spectrophotometer ( Thermo Fisher ) . Cells exposed to 25 μg / ml tunicamycin , a well - known Endoplasmic Reticulum ( ER ) stress inducer , served as positive controls because tunicamycin induces the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) in the ER . 1 μg RNA was reverse - transcribed using the High - Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) to obtain complementary DNA ( cDNA ) . 20 ng cDNA was mixed with ABclonal SYBR Green Master Mix ( AbClonal ) and primers for the human genes of interest ( Supplementary Table S1 ) , then plated in a single 384 - well plate . Total volume of the reaction mixture was 20 μl . The plate was centrifuged at 600x g for 2 mins at RT and loaded onto a QuantStudio 5 Real - time PCR System . PCR conditions were determined following AbClonal protocol . Samples representative for each treatment , as described above , were pipetted in triplicate for each gene . Amplicons were quantified by comparison of 3 - average ΔΔCT . Fold change in transcript levels were computed relative to ACTB respectively . The FASTDock program27 was used to identify putative binding sites on each of the target proteins discussed in our study . The default set of 18 chemical probes were used , and 2000 best docked poses"}
