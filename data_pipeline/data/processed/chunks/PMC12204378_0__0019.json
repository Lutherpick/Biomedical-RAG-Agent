Calls were manually labeled and parameters such as call number , duration , peak frequency , and inter - call interval were extracted for statistical analysis . In line with the Reduction principle of the 3Rs Guidelines in animal research , we minimized the number of animals used for USV analysis by reusing data from control and SMA mice across Fig . 4 , Fig . 7 , and Fig . S9 . These groups were shared across experiments to reduce the overall number of animals without compromising scientific integrity . The AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN – treated mutants were littermates of the other groups , and all recordings were performed concurrently . In this manuscript , N refers to the number of patients or mice in each group , and n refers to the number of cells analyzed . Results are presented as the mean ± standard error ( SE ) , based on at least three independent experiments involving three or more animals or patients per experimental group , unless specified otherwise in the figure legend . To assess the symmetry of data distribution , the Shapiro - Wilk normality test was applied . For comparisons between two groups , statistical analysis depended on the data ’ s distribution and the equality of standard deviations ( SDs ) . If the data followed a parametric distribution and the SDs were equal , an unpaired t - test or multiple t - test were used . When the SDs were unequal , Welch ’ s t - test was applied . For nonparametric distributions , Mann - Whitney or multiple Mann - Whitney tests were performed . For comparisons among three groups or more , a one - way ANOVA followed by Tukey ’ s multiple comparison test was used for parametric distributions . Nonparametric distributions were analyzed using the Kruskal - Wallis test with Dunn ’ s correction . In cases where SDs were unequal , a Welch ’ s ANOVA with Dunnett ’ s T3 multiple comparison test was performed . For time - course comparisons involving more than two groups , a two - way ANOVA with Tukey ’ s multiple comparison test was applied . The Log - rank ( Mantel – Cox ) test was used for survival analysis . The statistical tests used for each experiment are indicated in the respective figure legends . All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 10 , and p - values are reported within the figures . This is a list of supplementary files associated with this preprint .
