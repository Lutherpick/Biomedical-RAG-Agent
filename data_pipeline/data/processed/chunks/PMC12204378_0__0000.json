While selective vulnerability of specific neuronal populations often defines clinical presentation , mounting evidence suggests that circuit - level disruption across interconnected brain regions contributes to disease progression and phenotypic complexity1 , 2 . This is particularly relevant in motor neuron diseases that have been historically viewed as disorders solely driven by the loss of upper or lower motor neurons3 , 4 . Clinically relevant behaviors such as locomotion , posture , and vocalization depend on distributed circuits spanning the spinal cord and the brain , raising the possibility that broader neuronal involvement shapes clinical outcomes5 – 8 . However , our current understanding of the full spectrum of neural circuit dysfunctions contributing to the pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases remains incomplete and is likely not addressed by existing therapies . Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by a ubiquitous deficiency in the survival motor neuron ( SMN ) protein8 . Traditionally defined by degeneration of spinal and bulbar motor neurons , the most common and severe form of SMA ( Type I ) leads to paralysis , speech impairment , and early death if left untreated9 – 12 . SMN - restoring therapies have markedly improved survival but , even with early intervention , severe Type I SMA patients often exhibit persistent motor impairments alongside emerging social communication and cognitive deficits — including intellectual disability , absence of speech , and autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) 10 , 13 – 17 . These clinical findings suggest that SMA likely affects broader neuronal circuits beyond spinal motor neuron networks that are only partially or not at all targeted by current therapies . Preclinical studies in animal models have been instrumental in identifying neuronal populations beyond motor neurons that contribute to SMA pathogenesis . In severe mouse models of the disease , preventing cell - autonomous p53 - mediated death of motor neurons only partially rescues motor function18 – 27 , supporting clinical observations that additional neuronal circuits contribute to the SMA phenotype . Accordingly , several studies have demonstrated that local spinal interneurons , proprioceptive sensory - motor circuits , and brainstem networks independently contribute to distinct aspects of motor dysfunction in mouse and fly models of SMA21 , 22 , 25 , 28 – 33 . The clinical relevance of proprioceptive sensory - motor circuit pathology in the spinal cord has recently been confirmed in SMA patients34 , 35 . However , the presence of communication and cognitive deficits in SMA patients suggests involvement of brain regions beyond the spinal cord , although the specific regions and underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly defined . Among candidate regions , the cerebellum is particularly compelling due to its central role in motor control , sensory - motor integration , cognition , social processing , and its known involvement in the pathogenesis of ASD , an emerging comorbidity in SMA13 , 15 , 36 – 41 . In agreement , a number of SMA studies have reported cerebellar abnormalities42 – 47 . However , the prevalence , underlying mechanisms , and functional significance of cerebellar pathology remain poorly understood . Here , we identify a selective , cerebellar - autonomous pathology restricted to specific lobules associated with motor and social communication behaviors in a severe mouse model of SMA . Cerebellar pathology comprises progressive p53 - dependent death of select pools of Purkinje cells ( PCs ) as well as cerebellar"}
