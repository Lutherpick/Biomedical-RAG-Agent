{"doc_id": "PMC11275912_0", "chunk_index": 17, "chunk_total": null, "text": "a combination of in - silico MD simulations and cell - based assays , we provide evidence that FICD inhibitors C22 and 73 stably bind dimeric FICD , preferentially at the smaller dimeric interface or the TPR - II domain . We propose that this interaction prevents BiP AMPylation by either blocking the switch to an AMPylation - competent , monomeric state or abrogating BiP binding to FICD . The compounds also bind monomeric FICD , which inhibits BiP AMPylation ( Figure 7 ) . The finding that C22 and C73 moderately inhibit FICD - mediated BiP deAMPylation further suggests that the compounds may abrogate the transition from an AMPylation - competent monomer to a deAMPylation - competent dimeric state . Determining the structure of C22 - bound FICD will be a critical next step to confirm this proposed mode of action . Using pancreatic cells , we show that FICD inhibitor C22 enhances anterograde trafficking and proinsulin folding while reducing aggregated or misfolded proinsulin . These results are significant , as to the best of our knowledge , no other small molecule with similar capacity to improve proinsulin processing is described . Future proof - of - concept studies using in vivo models for proinsulin misfolding will provide first evidence for the therapeutic potential of using FICD inhibitors to mitigate autosomal dominant diabetes . This study takes the first steps towards understanding the structure - activity relationship ( SAR ) between FICD and compounds C22 and C73 . The described SAR - based analog testing represents a glance at the potential of SAR - based medical chemistry to further improve compound efficacy . Additional efforts will likely lead to the development of a more potent lead compound . We also failed to source compound C34 in reasonable quantities preventing the testing of this most promising molecule in more assays . Testing the compounds in more cell lines , stress conditions , and ultimately , in vivo are critical next steps towards defining their potential for future clinical use ."}
