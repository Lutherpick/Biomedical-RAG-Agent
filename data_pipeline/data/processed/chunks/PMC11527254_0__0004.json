Slices were incubated with chicken polyclonal anti - TH ( 1 : 2000 , Abcam , ab76442 ) , washed , and then incubated with donkey anti - chicken polyclonal antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 ( 1 : 250 , Jackson Immuno Research , 703 - 545 - 155 ) . Sections were washed with 0 . 1 M PB containing DAPI ( 2 μg / mL ; stock solution : 10 mg / mL , Millipore Sigma ) , then mounted and coverslipped using polyvinyl alcohol mounting media ( Millipore - Sigma , 10981 ) . A blinded operator performed image acquisition at two levels within the SNpc , spaced 740 μm apart , for the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres . The sections were visualized with an upright epifluorescence microscope ( AxioImager M2 , Zeiss ) , and images were acquired with Stereoinvestigator software , version 10 ( MBF Bioscience ) . Images were quantified using FIJI ( Image J version 1 . 53 ) . Mean grey values were measured in the SNpc and manually segmented based on anatomical references . 24 An average of ~ fifty coronal brain sections ( 30 μm thick ) were obtained from the ventral midbrain , covering a region approximately 1 . 44 mm in length , ranging from − 3 . 88 mm to − 2 . 46 mm from Bregma , according to Paxinos and Franklin ’ s atlas . 24 Brains were sliced using a Fisher Scientific NX - 50 cryostat . Every sixth coronal section was selected , yielding ~ 8 sections per brain . The staining and mounting procedures were carried out as described . 10 See Table S1 for the antibodies used . TH - and Nissl - positive neurons in the SNpc were stereologically counted in a bright field via the optical fractionation method using a Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Cambridge , UK ) and Stereo Investigator software ( Version 10 , MBF Bioscience , Magdeburg , Germany ) . Endpoints are presented as the total number of cells extrapolated based on the sample size . The size of the sampling grid covered 20 % of the SNpc and area of each section , and the thickness is defined respectively by equations 1 and 2 ( A = area , tQ − − average section thickness , ti = section thickness at site I , Qi = particles counted , m = number of sections ) . Following infusion of 20 μg of 6 - OHDA into the dorsal striatum , mice were sacrificed at select time points after surgery , and brains were harvested , sub - dissecting out SNpc and striatum for both ipsilateral and contralateral sides . Tissue and samples were prepared as detailed elsewhere23 with the following exceptions : the boiling step was omitted , and Bolt 4 % – 12 % Bis - Tris - Plus gels were used for better separation of high - molecular - weight proteins ( see Table S1 for all markers and respective primary antibodies ) . The blots were imaged using the Sapphire Molecular Imager and analyzed with Azure Spot software ( Azure Biosystems ) . Gel analysis was conducted using three control samples in each gel . Protein expression was normalized to a loading control — α - tubulin or glyceraldehyde 3 - triphosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) ."}
