These findings suggest that the model retains strong diagnostic capability even in the hyper ‐ acute phase , within the first 1 . 5 h after stroke onset . t ‐ SNE results across different time segments , the results demonstrate that the deep learning model can accurately distinguish different events within each time segment . To eliminate the potential influence of anesthesia or other confounding factors on the EEG data , we compared the EEG recordings from the pMCAO group and the sham group . As shown in Table 1 , the results demonstrated that the classification model was able to accurately distinguish between the two groups . This finding suggests that the excellent performance of the model is closely associated with the occurrence of stroke rather than being attributed to anesthesia or other external factors . By analyzing the significant differences between the pMCAO and sham groups , we further validated the specific changes in EEG signals associated with the stroke state . These findings confirm that the classification model exhibits high accuracy and reliability in differentiating between stroke and non ‐ stroke conditions . Based on t ‐ SNE analysis , the results demonstrate that the deep learning model can accurately distinguish different events within each time segment we defined . By mapping the EEG signals of each time interval into a lower ‐ dimensional space , we observed significant signal separation , indicating that the model effectively extracted key features differentiating stroke from healthy states ( Figure 4 ) . Notably , the model was able to independently and accurately distinguish events in each time segment , showcasing its superior performance and stability in handling EEG time ‐ series data . This finding further confirms the model ' s capability to address the rapidly changing dynamic features of hyperacute stroke and provides strong support for early stroke diagnosis . In this study , we employed the EEGNet deep learning framework to identify the hyper ‐ acute phase of ischemic stroke in a mouse model induced by anterior circulation occlusion . Our results demonstrated that EEG data holds significant diagnostic value in the identification of hyper ‐ acute stroke . The model based on EEG data achieved robust classification performance , effectively distinguishing LVO stroke across all analyzed time intervals within the hyper ‐ acute phase . Notably , the earliest time point where the model achieved successful identification was 1 – 1 . 55 h post ‐ stroke induction . LVO stroke represents one of the most severe subtypes of acute ischemic stroke , often associated with high mortality and disability rates . Early and accurate identification of LVO stroke is crucial for timely intervention , as the thrombectomy window for anterior circulation is typically only 6 h [ 3 , 26 ] . EEG has the potential for early stroke detection and shows high prospects for application in acute stroke diagnosis [ 18 , 27 ] . Several clinical studies have explored the changes in EEG following LVO stroke , obtaining statistically significant results . Shreve et al . found delta band power ( p = 0 . 004 ) and the alpha / delta frequency band ratio ( p = 0 . 0006 ) each significantly distinguished patients with large acute ischemic stroke from all other patients with suspected stroke [ 28 ] . The study by van Meenen LCC et al . identified alterations in theta and alpha power ; a"}
