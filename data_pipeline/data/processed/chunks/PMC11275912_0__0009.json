Figure legends specify the utilized tests for each data panel . p values were computed to determine statistical significance . If a p - value is less than 0 . 05 , it is flagged with one star ( * ) . If a p - value is less than 0 . 01 , it is flagged with 2 stars ( * * ) . If a p - value is less than 0 . 001 , it is flagged with three stars ( * * * ) and if a p - value is less than 0 . 0001 , it is flagged with four stars ( * * * * ) . All hit validation assays were performed at least in triplicate . For western blot - based quantifications , figures in the main manuscript show one representative western blot . The other replicates are shared in the supplementary figures . To identify molecules that inhibit FICD - dependent protein AMPylation , we optimized an in vitro fluorescence polarization ( FP ) assay to measure FICD auto - AMPylation ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) . In this assay , we used a fluorescent ATP analog N6 - ( 6 - Aminohexyl ) - ATP - 5 - FAM ( FL - ATP ) ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) to measure auto - AMPylation of recombinant FICDE234G ( Supplementary Figure S2C ) . Unlike wild - type ( WT ) FICD , which purifies in an auto - inhibited conformation , FICDE234G contains a dislodged α - inh domain , relieving auto - inhibition and turning this variant into a constitutive AMPylase8 , 9 , 11 . To determine optimal reaction conditions , we tested different concentrations of FICDE234G ( Supplementary Figure S2D ) and buffer components ( Supplementary Figure S2E ) . We found that using 1 μM FICD and 0 . 25 μM FL - ATP in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , 1mM EDTA and 1mM DTT provided a reliable dynamic window enabling to screen for both FICDE234G activators and inhibitors . We next validated these reaction conditions comparing FP measurements of auto - inhibited FICD WT and FICDE234G in a 384 well plate setup , which confirmed assay reproducibility and reliability ( Z - factor = 0 . 83 ) ( Figure 1A ) . Using this optimized assay , we screened two distinct small molecule libraries : a commercially available ( Selleck ) repurposing library comprised of 5 , 120 FDA - approved compounds ( Figure 1B ) , and a custom library consisting of 79 , 360 compounds from the Dart Neuroscience Collection . We maintained an average Z ’ score of > 0 . 6 and an average signal - to - baseline ratio ( S / B ) of > 3 ( Figure 1C ) during our screen , offering a large dynamic window to identify potential FICD inhibitors . In our primary screen , we defined hits as compounds that inhibit FICDE234G activity by > = 20 % or show a Standard Deviation ( S . D . ) > = 3 from WT FICD activity as primary hits . Using these criteria , we identified 4 , 019 compounds in our primary screen ( 4 . 7 % hit rate ) . To validate our primary hits , we followed a classic small molecule testing paradigm ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) . First , we re"}
