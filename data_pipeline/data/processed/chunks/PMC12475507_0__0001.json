{"doc_id": "PMC12475507_0", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_total": null, "text": ", particularly within the first 6 h , remains difficult [ 20 ] . Current research highlights a lack of diagnostic studies focusing specifically on this critical early time window [ 14 ] . To address this limitation , our study employs a permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery ( pMCAO ) mouse model to simulate the stroke process [ 21 ] and obtain high ‐ resolution EEG data during the hyper ‐ acute phase . By leveraging deep learning techniques to extract pertinent features from these early EEG recordings , our goal is to establish a robust diagnostic framework capable of identifying stroke ‐ related biomarkers in the crucial hours after symptom onset , thereby providing valuable insights into early detection mechanisms and laying a foundational framework for future clinical investigations . Twenty male mice of C57BL / 6 ( 8 – 12 weeks old and weighing 25 – 30 g ) were used in the study . Animals were maintained on a 12 ‐ h light and dark cycle ( light on at 8 AM ) with freely available food and water . All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) of the Chinese Institute for Brain Research , Beijing , China ( Approval ID : LARC ‐ T019 ) . The procedures were deemed ethically acceptable and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , the ARRIVE guidelines , and all relevant national regulations governing animal research . Stainless steel 16 electrodes ( Kedou Products ) were employed to record electrical activity . Animals were anesthetized using isoflurane at a concentration of 3 % , followed by 2 % for maintenance during electrode placement . The recording electrodes were positioned in each hemisphere according to specific stereotaxic coordinates relative to the bregma , with the schematic diagram of electrode recording in Figure 1A . These electrodes were implanted subdurally through small holes drilled into the skull , secured with stainless steel screws ( Kedou ) , and subsequently sealed with dental cement . Following the surgical procedure , mice received postoperative analgesia ( Metachem , 0 . 1 mg / kg ) and were allowed to recover for 7 days . ( A ) Recording of EEG .

Following electrode implantation and a post ‐ surgical recovery period , mice were recorded over 7 consecutive days , 1 day baseline ( pre ‐ stroke ) , 5 h poststroke ( P2 ‐ P6 ) and p ' MCAO was induced at P0 ; P1 refers to the anesthesia recovery phase , during which EEG monitoring was not conducted . Ten mice received pMCAO . In brief , a silicon ‐ coated monofilament ( Cinontech Ltd , Beijign , China ) was introduced into the external carotid artery ( ECA ) and advanced carefully through the arterial lumen into the internal carotid artery ( ICA ) , progressing toward the middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) . The filament is advanced until a firm resistance is felt , indicating that it has reached the MCA and caused occlusion . Postoperatively , the mice are placed in"}
