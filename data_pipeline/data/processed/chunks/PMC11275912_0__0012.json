Two of these putative binding sites were particularly interesting : the smaller , potentially more flexible dimeric interface11 ( site # 1 ) , and residues near the Tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR - II ) domain ( site # 2 ) ( Supplementary Figure 6B ) . C22 displays a stronger binding affinity ( − 28 . 86 + / − 4 . 89 kcal / mol ) for site # 1 than site # 2 ( − 20 . 83 + / 2 . 75 kcal / mol ) while C73 displays similar binding affinities of − 17 . 95 + / − 5 . 25 kcal / mol and − 15 . 232 + / 9 . 99 kcal / mol to sites # 1 and # 2 , respectively . Moreover , equilibrium MD simulations performed in the presence of explicit water molecules show that both compounds retain their respective binding modes with marginal deviations from the initial docked pose . This is evidenced by the fact that the structural Root Mean Square Deviation ( RMSD ) ( of only the heavy atoms ) for both compounds did not exceed 6 . 5 Å from the initial docked poses for majority of the MD simulation time - course ( Supplementary Figure 6C ) . Molecular Mechanics Poisson - Boltzmann Surface Area ( MM / PBSA ) calculations are considered more accurate in estimating binding free energies of protein - ligand complexes than scoring algorithms of most docking programs51 . Hence , we used MM - PBSA scores as indicators of absolute binding energies for poses obtained from MD simulations of our docked FICD - inhibitor complexes . We found that residues near the TPR - II domain , which previously constituted the 2nd ranked site for C22 , displayed approximately two - fold higher MMPBSA score of − 28 . 70 + / − 4 . 91 kcal / mol as compared to the smaller dimeric interface ( – 14 . 74 + / − 5 . 02 kcal / mol ) . This change can be attributed to a stronger binding mode because of the cation - π interactions between the guanidinium group on the sidechain of ARG180 ( packed against the TPR - II domain ) and the two aryl groups of C22 ( Figure 2A ) . In contrast , the only prominent interaction is a hydrogen bond ( H - bond ) between the nitrile group in C22 and SER288 of one of the monomers at site # 1 ( Figure 2A ) , which could explain the lower affinity for that site . C73 , the deprotonated form of C22 , in accordance with our previous docking results , shows slightly favorable binding at site # 2 ( – 269 . 61 + / − 16 . 70 kcal / mol ) compared to site # 1 ( − 256 . 38 + / − 7 . 31 kcal / mol ) . This slightly increased affinity is a result of the favorable cation - π interactions as well as a H - bond with the ARG180 sidechain at site # 1 compared to H - bonds with the sidechains of ARG308 and ARG293 via its nitrile group at site # 2 ( Figure 2B ) . In the next step , we used the same protocol to identify and rank putative binding sites of C22 and C73 on the strictly"}
