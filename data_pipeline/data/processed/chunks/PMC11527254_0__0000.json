PD is a multifaceted disorder encompassing motor and non - motor manifestations . 1 Neurodegeneration and aggregation of Lewy bodies ( LB ) extend well beyond the nigrostriatal tract , 2 affecting various neurotransmitters such as dopamine , 3 norepinephrine , 4 serotonin , 5 and GABA . 6 Despite the limitations of modeling PD in small animals , the understanding of PD pathophysiology and cellular disease mechanisms have primarily been driven by animal models mirroring certain pathological aspects of the disease . However , such advancements have not translated into definitive treatments to cure or delay neurodegeneration in PD , with current therapeutic approaches primarily focused on symptomatic management . 7 Though numerous mouse models of PD have emerged over the years to elucidate PD ’ s cellular , genetic , and environmental aspects , 8 – 11 only a handful can effectively serve as platforms for drug screening . 10 , 12 , 13 Notably , most preclinical drug testing relies on PD models that have been successfully used for more than four decades , i . e . , systemic injection or local infusion of neurotoxins such as 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) or 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) into rodents . 11 , 14 , 15 The neurotoxin 6 - OHDA was first discovered in 1959 and employed by Ungerstedt in 1968 in rats as a catecholaminergic denervating agent . 16 In the present study , we chose the dorsal striatum as the site of infusion to achieve gradual and progressive loss of dopaminergic cells in a retrograde fashion as demonstrated elsewhere17 and avoid undesired effects such as high mortality , nonspecific toxicity , and acute neuronal loss arising from targeting regions such as the medial forebrain bundle , the ventricles , and substantia nigra pars compacta ( SNpc ) . Existing reports guide the behavioral and histopathological phenotyping of 6 - OHDA lesioned mice . 11 , 18 , 19 For example , Stott et al . noted a swift loss of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase - positive ( TH + ) fibers , accompanied by TH + cell loss starting on day 6 and microglial proliferation on day 9 after the striatal convection - enhanced delivery ( CED ) of 10 μg of 6 - OHDA . 18 Similarly , Masini et al . offered comprehensive guidance on pre - and post - operative care to minimize mortality after bilateral infusion of 4 μg of 6 - OHDA . They also reported sex differences and cell loss in the SNpc and ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) regions . 11 The primary aim of our study was to extensively characterize the histopathological and biochemical changes resulting from the unilateral infusion of 6 - OHDA into the dorsal striatum ( Fig . 1 ) . 20 In a first for this model , we mapped TH depletion in 3D across the whole brain by imaging immunolabeled solvent - cleared brains with light sheet fluorescence microscopy ( LSFM ) and extending the quantitative functionality of UNRAVEL21 to use voxel - wise maps of differential immunolabeling for precise TH + neuron projection mapping in the regions most severely affected by 6 - OHDA . This innovation enabled us to visualize and quantify changes in TH + cell and fiber density unbiasedly in both ipsilateral and"}
