For immunostaining of NMJs , mice were sacrificed or perfused and the muscle was dissected , immediately post - fixed with 4 % PFA for 2 h and transferred into PBS . The next day , single muscle fibers were teased and washed 3 times in PBS for 10 min each followed by staining of the postsynaptic part of the NMJ with a - bungarotoxin ( BTX ) labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 in PBS for 20 min . Subsequently , the muscle fibers were washed 5 times in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 5 % donkey serum in PBS with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ( PBS - T ) for 1 h . Mouse anti - Neurofilament ( NF ) and anti - Synaptic vesicle 2 ( SV2 ) antibodies to immunolabel the presynaptic aspect of the NMJ were applied in blocking solution overnight at 4 ° C ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . The muscle fibers were then washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS . Secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h in PBS - T at room temperature . Finally , the muscle fibers were washed 3 times in PBS for 10 min and mounted on slides covered with glycerol : PBS ( 3 : 7 ) as previously described24 . For PC quantification and lobule - specific analysis , 70 μm vermis sections were scanned using a 10x objective ( NA = 0 . 40 ) . A z - step size of 4 . 0 μm was chosen to include PCP2 + PC somata . Leica LAS X software automatically stitched individual horizontal image planes into a full image of each vermis section . Each stack was split into two smaller stacks ( ~ 35 μm ) for easier quantification of PCs and lobule sizes . The mean was calculated from each stack . Quantitative analysis of the vermis sections was done with Leica LAS AF software . The area of the entire vermis and individual lobules was measured using manual tracing . This method was also used to outline and quantify the molecular layer , PC layer , GC layer , and white matter for each of the 10 lobules . The perimeter of the PC layer was manually traced , and PCs were counted within each lobule . Three vermis sections per animal were analyzed . For all synaptic density scans , a segment of the molecular layer from a single lobule was selected , and images were taken using a 63x oil objective ( NA = 1 . 30 ) for optimal magnification . A z - step size of 0 . 4 μm was used to capture detailed images of synapses on PC somata and dendrites . The “ z - compensation ” function adjusted laser intensity at each z - step to ensure balanced signal quality while avoiding sample damage . Two scans were performed per animal . Synaptic density on PCs was analyzed using Leica LAS X software . For each investigated lobule , a minimum 5 PCs were randomly selected for analysis of VGLUT1 + , VGLUT2 + , and VGAT + synapses . Synapses were manually counted on the soma and on dendritic segments at two distances ( 0 – 50 μm and 50 – 100 μm ) from the soma . To minimize background - related errors , only synapses visible in at least two consecutive z - stack images were included ."}
