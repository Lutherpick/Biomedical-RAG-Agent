This study wanted to utilize the Scn2a ASO mouse model as a proxy for identifying the consequences of premature truncating variants ( PTV ) . However , Scn2a haploinsufficiency is not generated until mice are between 2 and 3 months of age and neural networks have been fully established . Therefore , this model may not fully capture how prematurely truncating SCN2A can change neural circuits and signaling as the animal developed typically until induction and critical periods of Nav1 . 2 involvement could have been missed . Cre - driver lines have been commonly utilized to generate developmental stage , cell , and tissue - specific deletion or reduction of Scn2a . For instance , two Cre driver lines were utilized to delete Scn2a in either forebrain excitatory neurons ( Emx1 - Cre ) or global deletion in inhibitory neurons ( Vgat - Cre ) in an Scn2a floxed animal ( Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . Based on western blot data from P0 . 5 animals , Scn2afl / fl / Emx1 - Cre had a 30 % reduction of Nav1 . 2 , while Scn2afl / fl / Vgat - Cre resulted in around a 60 % reduction of Nav1 . 2 expression , further confirming that at least early postnatal mice express Nav1 . 2 in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ) . Both Scn2afl / fl / Emx1 - Cre and Scn2afl / fl / Vgat - Cre mice died within a few days of birth , likely due to homozygous loss of Nav1 . 2 ( Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . Western blot of Scn2afl / + / Emx1 - Cre and Scn2afl / + / Vgat - Cre adult animals , however , revealed that Scn2afl / + / Emx1 - Cre had around 50 % reduced Nav1 . 2 expression in neocortex and hippocampus , but no significant reduction of Nav1 . 2 was noted in Scn2afl / + / Vgat - Cre mice , suggesting that in adult animals Nav1 . 2 is mainly expressed in excitatory neurons ( Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . Furthermore , Scn2afl / + / Emx1 - Cre and Scn2afl / + / Vgat - Cre mice were viable , fertile , and outwardly healthy , although about a third of Scn2afl / + / Vgat - Cre mice died unexpectedly around P18 - P25 of unknown causes ( Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . The unexplained and sporadic early death in Scn2afl / + / Vgat - Cre mice could point to Nav1 . 2 having an important role in inhibitory cells early in development that is currently not understood . Scn2a + / − mice have also been bred with a Vgat - venus line to fluorescently label inhibitory neurons to discern them from excitatory ( Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . The Vgat - venus / Scn2a + / − mice helped determine that inhibitory cells do not experience the same alterations in excitability demonstrated in glutamatergic excitatory neurons , which indicates that loss of Nav1 . 2 impacts inhibitory and excitatory cells in distinct ways . Behaviorally , Scn2afl / + / Emx1 - Cre had significantly more rearing events in the open field assay than wildtype C57BL / 6J littermates ( Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ) . Scn2afl / + / Emx1 - Cre mice further displayed signs"}
