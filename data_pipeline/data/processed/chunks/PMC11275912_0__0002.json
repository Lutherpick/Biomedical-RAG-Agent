Briefly , pSMT - WT BIP , kindly gifted by Dr . Liu ( Virginia Commonwealth University ) , was expressed in E . coli BL21 cells grown in TB medium containing 50 μg / mL of kanamycin to an optical density of 0 . 6 . Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG for 5 – 6 h at 30 ° C . Thereafter , bacterial pellets were sonicated in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 15 , 000 × g for 30 mins . Supernatants were poured over nickel resin pre - equilibrated with lysis buffer . Thereafter , the resin was washed with a wash buffer . His - tagged proteins were eluted with an elution buffer ( 50 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 250 mM NaCl , 250 mM imidazole ) . Fractions containing BiP were verified for purity by Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate - Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) , pooled , and dialyzed in a dialysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 0 ) . Purified FICD and BiP protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the Lambert - Beer law24 . Thereafter , FICD and BiP aliquots were flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 ° C in storage buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , pH 8 . 0 ) . Binding kinetics of 45 – 457FICDE234G to the fluorescent ATP analog N6 - ( 6 - Aminohexyl ) - ATP - 5 - FAM ( FL - ATP ) was determined by incubating increasing concentrations of the enzyme ( 0 . 75 μM – 2 . 5 μM ) , which was dissolved in an AMPylation buffer ( 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , 1mM EDTA and 1mM DTT ) , with 250 nM FL - ATP ( final concentration ) . A Multidrop nano 384 - well reagent dispenser ( ThermoFisher , USA ) was used to add FICD , dissolved in AMPylation buffer , and FL - ATP ( dissolved in ultrapure MilliQ water ) to a single 384 - well black - bottom , black - walled microplate . The total reaction volume was 20 μL . The plate was snap - centrifuged at 1000 × g for 60s and initial fluorescence polarization measurements were recorded using a BMG Pherastar plate - reader fitted with 485 / 530 nm filters before it was incubated in the dark at 37 ° C . Thereafter , the plate was loaded onto the plate reader and assessed for fluorescence polarization every 15 mins from the beginning of the incubation until 120 mins had elapsed . Samples containing FL - ATP in AMPylation buffer were used for setting the desired fluorescence gain adjustment . A Multidrop nano 384 - well reagent dispenser was used to pipette 2 μM of FICDE234G dissolved in AMPylation buffer into columns 1 – 22 . 2 μM 45 – 457WT FICD was similarly added to column 23 as negative controls . FICDE234G enzyme was then incubated with compounds or 1 % ( v / v ) DMSO ( positive control ) for 10 – 15 mins at room temperature ( RT ) . The Pintool Sciclone ALHD 3000 ( Perkin Elmer ) equipment was used to transfer 200 nL of DMSO -"}
