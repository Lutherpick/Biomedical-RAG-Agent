Scn2afl / + mice did not display spontaneous seizure activity but did display decreases in neuronal activity and excitatory synaptic transmission ( Shin et al . , 2019 ) . Additionally , a close electrophysical investigation of hippocampi from these mice revealed that the Schaffer collateral - CA1 pathway of these animals was typical ; however , long - term potentiation was suppressed without affecting long - term depression through mechanisms independent of NMDAR - mediated synaptic transmission ( Shin et al . , 2019 ) . Furthermore , Scn2afl / + had impairments in reversal learning but displayed no measurable changes in grooming and anxiety - like behaviors ( Shin et al . , 2019 ) ( Figure 2 , Supplemental Table 2 ) . It is important to mention that although no changes in anxiety - like behavior were detected , juvenile Scn2a fl / + mice displayed less overall locomotion in the open field test than their wildtype counterparts . This finding could further highlight a potential difference in the role of Nav1 . 2 in juvenile vs adult animals ( Shin et al . , 2019 ) . Furthermore , RNA scope data from the Scn2a fl / + mice indicate that Scn2a mRNA is expressed in both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus in adult animals , suggesting that Scn2a could also function and exist in inhibitory cells . A similar construct , the Scn2a + / KI model , was generated by deleting exons 3 – 5 of one Scn2a allele and inserting an in - frame eGFP sequence to visualize cells that expressed Scn2a ( Tamura et al . , 2022 ) . Seizures were induced in these animals with pentylenetetrazole , but no difference was identified in susceptibility to seizures between Scn2a + / KI and wildtype C57BL / 6J mice ( Tamura et al . , 2022 ) . These additional constitutive Scn2a + / − models indicate that although all express between 50 % to 60 % of native Scn2a protein , the effect of each manipulation does not have an identical impact on phenotypic presentation . There is also at least one model that paired the Planells - Cases Scn2a + / − mouse with a Kcna1 + / – mouse to generate mice heterozygous for both genes or heterozygous for Scn2a but null for Kcna1 ( Mishra et al . , 2017 ) . Kcna1 encodes for KV1 . 1 , a voltage - gated potassium channel , and is a monogenetic risk gene for epilepsy . The mixed model enabled a close investigation of how Scn2a and potassium channels interact , which is discussed in more detail later in this manuscript . Both Scn2a + / − ; Kcna1 + / − mice and Scn2a + / − ; Kcna1 − / − animals had attenuated repetitive behaviors compared Scn2a + / − mice and were more similar to wildtype C57BL / 6J mice ( Indumathy et al . , 2021 ) . It has also been noted that the seizure phenotype apparent in Kcna1 − / − was attenuated in Scn2a + / − ; Kcna1 − / − mice ( Mishra et al . , 2017 ) . The improvements in behavior and seizure phenotype of Scn2a + / − ; Kcna1 + / − and Scn2a + / − ; Kcna1 − / − suggest that Nav1 . 2 and Kv1 . 1 may"}
