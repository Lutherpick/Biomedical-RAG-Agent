Lesion extent was assessed using western blotting to measure striatal TH protein levels , stereological counts of TH + cells , and mean fluorescent intensity of TH levels in the SNpc . TH protein levels in the striatum of male mice showed a gradual decrease in dopaminergic fibers over 14 days following a 5 μg 6 - OHDA infusion ( Fig . 5A – B ; Fig . S6 P ) , nearing significance only on day 14 compared to controls ( p = 0 . 089 ) . In contrast , the higher doses of 10 and 20 μg of 6 - OHDA induced a significant depletion of TH fibers ( 10 μg : one - way ANOVA F ( 3 , 22 ) = 7 . 513 , p = 0 . 0012 , 20 μg : F ( 3 , 16 ) = 59 . 90 , p < 0 . 0001 ) as early as 24 hours post - infusion ( Fig . 5C – D ; Fig S6 Q - R ) . Interestingly , female mice exhibited a reduced susceptibility to 6 - OHDA toxicity in the striatum , particularly in the 5 μg and 10 μg groups , where striatal TH protein levels tended to decrease on day 1 and day 7 , but no impact was detected on day 14 ( Fig . 5E – H ) . Concurrently , stereological counting of TH + neurons and quantifying mean fluorescent intensity in the SNpc were performed for male and female mice . Stereological counting revealed an abrupt , delayed loss of TH + cells in male mice following infusion of 5 μg or 10 μg of 6 - OHDA at day 14 ( Fig . 6A C – D , 5 μg : F ( 3 , 23 ) = 14 . 55 , p < 0 . 0001 , 10 μg : F ( 3 , 25 ) = 22 . 22 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . The 20 μg dose of 6 - OHDA led to a more rapid decline in TH cell prevalence over time ( F ( 3 , 22 ) = 8 . 726 , p = 0 . 0005 ) , with significant reductions on day 7 and day 14 ( Fig . 6A and E ) . The TH - , Nissl + neuronal population in the SNpc was similarly affected across the 6 - OHDA dosages ( one - way ANOVAs : 5 μg , p = 0 . 0124 ; 10 μg , p = 0 . 0006 ; 20 μg , p = 0 . 0024 ) ( Fig . 6F – H ) . Measurement of mean fluorescence intensity in the SNpc in male mice showed a similar temporal pattern of TH loss across the 6 - OHDA dosages when expressed as a percentage of the contralateral side ( Fig . 7A – D ) . TH fluorescence was reduced by 5 μg and 10 μg dosages on day 14 ( Fig . 7A – C , one - way ANOVAs : 5 μg , F ( 3 , 24 ) = 18 . 80 , p < 0 . 0001 ; 10 μg F ( 3 , 25 ) = 23 . 97 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . The 20 - μg dose of 6 - OHDA accelerated the decrease in TH - IF , with reductions observed on days 7 and 14 ( Fig . 7D ) ."}
