The lowest dose ( 5 μg ) causes a gradual reduction in striatal TH + expression , which may not reach significance but still leads to SNpc neuron loss by day 14 , indicating a milder injury , which could be easier to rescue . This makes it a sensitive readout for testing neurotherapeutics aimed at stabilizing pre - synaptic terminals or exploring striatal mechanisms , provided the studies are sufficiently powered . In contrast , the highest dose ( 20 μg ) rapidly reduces TH + neurons in the SNpc within 7 days , making it better suited for efficient screening of experimental therapies attempting to preserve cell bodies and slow rostrocaudal degeneration of dopaminergic neurons . These findings should guide the dose selection in studies targeting specific neuroprotective strategies . The optical fractionator stereology cell counting method is considered the gold standard for quantification of dopaminergic lesions in the SNpc . 48 – 50 However , mean fluorescent intensity measurements have also been successfully employed in several studies , 18 , 51 producing comparable results . Our data reinforces using mean fluorescent intensity as a proxy for TH cell densities , a more time - efficient alternative to the labor - intensive stereology cell counting method . While many studies have documented astrocyte and microglial reactivity in rats and mice treated with 6 - OHDA , 17 , 52 , 53 none have previously examined cytokine / chemokine levels using a 48 - plex immunoassay . Here , we report a distinct chemokine / cytokine signature in the SNpc on days 1 , 3 , and 7 following 6 - OHDA infusion . The robust upregulation of chemokines from 6 - OHDA is likely driven by proinflammatory , activated microglia , which promote chemoattraction ( e . g . , via CCL5 ) of CD8 + T helper cells , eosinophils , and monocytes . In turn , chemokines such as MIP - 1α , MIP - 1β , and MIP - 2 create a sustained positive feedback loop of proinflammatory microglial activation and proliferation . 54 , 55 IP - 10 / CXCL10 signaling leads to the activation of apoptotic pathways , 56 while upregulation of the cytokine BAFF / TNFSF13B , primarily released by B cells , aligns with evidence of B and T cell infiltration in the brains of 6 - OHDA - infused mice . 57 This also explains the increase in RANTES / CCL5 , predominantly related to T - cell infiltration . 57 Our observation of a robust , rapid inflammatory response suggests early activation of microglia and astrocytes driven by damaged SNpc neurons . 17 Glial reactivity is further evidenced by the increased protein levels of CD68 , Iba1 , LAMP1 , and GFAP in the striatum on day 3 , although the mechanisms underlying activation at the infusion site may differ . Notably , the cytokine fingerprint detected in the 6 - OHDA model is not entirely detrimental ; for example , RANTES / CCL5 has shown neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer ’ s disease , 58 while RANTES and MIP - 1β have potent recruitment activity toward T lymphocytes , which are protective in 6 - OHDA - treated mice . 59 In contrast , the cytokine profile in PD patients is substantially different , with increased levels of TNF - α , IL - 1β , IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 6 , TGF - α , TGF - β1 , and TGF - β2 . 60 These differences"}
