After repeated washes for three days , brains were incubated with the secondary antibody ( Table S1 ) . After three days of washing , brains were embedded in 1 % [ w / v ] low melting point agarose ( ThermoFisher ; R0801 ; dissolved in 1xPBS , 0 . 001 % [ w / v ] heparin , and 0 . 02 % [ w / v ] sodium azide ) , dehydrated again , incubated overnight in dichloromethane : methanol ( 66 : 33 ) at RT , incubated twice in dichloromethane for 15 minutes , and cleared / stored in an airtight tube containing dibenzyl - ether . After immunostaining and clearing , brains were imaged in 3D as described by Rijsketic et al . 21 Briefly , agarose - embedded brains were attached to a c - clamp sample holder and lowered into an imaging chamber ( Translucence Biosystems ) filled with ethyl cinnamate . A Zeiss Lightsheet 7 controlled via Zen Black ( 3 . 1 ) was used to acquire tiled z - stacks spanning the whole brain ( 10 % tile overlap ) , which were later stitched with Zen Blue ( 3 . 3 ) . Pivot scanning and averaging of left and right light sheets ( 11 μm thick ) minimized shadows and evened out illumination , respectively . 2D images were acquired using a 2 . 5x detection objective and 0 . 52x zoom , resulting in an x and y resolution of 3 . 5232 μm . Voxels were ~ isotropic with z - steps of 3 . 5 μm . Limiting the field of view to ~ 800 × 688 pixels optimized uniformity of illumination and resolution in the z dimension . 488 nm light ( 15 % of 30 mW ; 505 – 530 nm emission ) excited autofluorescence for brain registration , while 561 nm light ( 3 % of 75 mW ; mirror : SBS LP 560 ; 585 nm LP emission ) excited TH immunofluorescence ( TH - IF ) . The exposure time for both wavelengths was 50 ms . iDISCO + / LSFM data was analyzed using UNRAVEL ( https : / / b - heifets . github . io / UNRAVEL / ) . 21 Code refactored to Python can be accessed here ( github . com / b - heifets / UNRAVEL / ) . In certain cases , older scripts were used ( https : / / github . com / b - heifets / UNRAVEL / releases / tag / v0 . 1 . 2 - feature - branch ) . Information on older code is available here ( github . com / b - heifets / UNRAVEL / blob / feature / Heifets_lab_guides / UNRAVEL_guide_Heifets_lab_021623 . pdf ) . Briefly , autofluorescence images were registered with an iDISCO / LSFM template ( aligned with the Allen brain atlas ) , and immunofluorescence images were background subtracted and warped to atlas space for 2 × 2 voxel - wise ANOVAs . Significant voxels in f - statistic p - value maps ( α = 0 . 05 ) were evaluated further with voxel - wise post hoc t - tests . The resulting"}
