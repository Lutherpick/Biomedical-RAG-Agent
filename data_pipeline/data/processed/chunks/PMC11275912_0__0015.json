In cell - based assays , we further observed that C34 promoted a concentration - dependent decrease in FICD mediated BiP AMPylation ( Figure 4B ) . We observe approximately 75 % decrease in BiP AMPylation levels at 1 μM and a near complete inhibition of BiP AMPylation at 5 and 10 μM ( Figure 4C ) . This was superior to the FICD inhibition profile of both C22 ( Figure 1D ) and C73 ( Figure 1F ) , which reduced BiP AMPylation levels by approximately 80 % at the highest tested concentration ( 10 μM ) . These results indicate functional group flexibility in the biaryl region of the scaffold could be further exploited to rationally improve these FICD inhibitors . Recent reports link two mutations in the FICD active site to infancy - onset diabetes and motor neuron degeneration21 , 22 . In both cases , the pathogenic FICD variants , FICDR371S and FICDR374H , excessively AMPylate BiP . We thus tested whether FICD inhibitors C22 and C73 suppress FICDR371S and FICDR374H in vitro . Using our FP assay , we observed that both FICDR371S ( Figure 5A ) and FICDR374H ( Figure 5B ) showed auto - AMPylation activity , yet substantially less than FICDE234G . Incubating both pathologic FICD mutants with increasing concentrations of FICD inhibitors did not significantly decrease auto - AMPylation levels except at the highest tested concentration ( 100 μM ) where C22 and C73 elicited auto - AMPylation reduction by approximately 30 % and 20 % , respectively ( Figure . 5C ) . Despite limited inhibition of auto - AMPylation , both C22 and C73 significantly reduced BiP AMPylation in vitro at a molar ratio of 20 : 1 ( inhibitor : protein ) ( Figure 5D – E ) . These results indicate that Arg371Ser and Arg374His mutations have a distinct impact on FICD auto - and BiP AMPylation and define C22 and C73 as potent inhibitors of pathologic FICD variants . Recent work suggests a novel link between infancy - onset diabetes and excessive FICD - mediated BiP AMPylation21 . Since BiP ’ s chaperone function is required for proinsulin folding53 and FICD - mediated BiP AMPylation inhibits its chaperone activity8 , 9 , 13 , 46 , we investigated whether reducing BiP AMPylation using FICD inhibitors improves proinsulin folding and secretion in Min6 pancreatic β - cells were treated with 20 μM FICD inhibitors ( inhibitor concentration was optimized as shown in Supplementary Figure S10A – B ) or DMSO for 16 hours , and both conditioned media ( M ) and cell lysates ( C ) were probed for proinsulin levels ( Figure 6A ) . Proinsulin protein content in the complete system ( M + C ) was unaffected by the 16 h treatment with both C22 ( Figure 6B ) and C73 ( Supplementary Figure S10C ) . Interestingly , we observed an approximately 8 - fold increase in proinsulin levels in M as compared to C when cells were treated with C22 ( Figure 6C ) and a roughly 2 - fold increase when cells were exposed to C73 ( Supplementary Figure S10D ) . To elucidate the reason for such an observation , we investigated whether C22 affected proinsulin protein folding by measuring the abundance of aberrant"}
