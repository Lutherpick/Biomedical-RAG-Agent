Considering the well - established influence of excitatory synapses from parallel or climbing fibers on USVs in early postnatal pups82 – 84 , one possibility is that loss of these synaptic inputs , which is not corrected by selective SMN rescue in PCs , contributes to the incomplete rescue of vocalization deficits in SMA mice . In addition , recent studies have shown that the anterior cingulate cortex and bulbar neurons modulate social vocalizations in mice99 , pointing to a potentially broader involvement of neuronal networks in these neurodevelopmental deficits of SMA mice for future investigation . Cognitive disability , severe delay of speech , poor social interaction , and diagnosis of ASD are emerging clinical features in Type I SMA patients treated with disease modifying therapies14 – 17 , 100 . Interestingly , most of these SMA patients received the SMN - inducing antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen15 , 17 , which fails to restore SMN levels in the cerebellum101 . Furthermore , motor and social communicative deficits have been associated with focal pathology in cerebellar lobules VI and VII in aging , Alzheimer ’ s and Parkinson ’ s diseases as well as in ASD patients and mouse models37 , 56 – 61 , 65 , 66 , 93 , 102 . Building on previous evidence and our new findings , we propose that the cerebellar pathology and communication defects identified in a severe mouse model may be linked to the cognitive and speech impairments observed specifically in Type I SMA patients . In summary , this study uncovers a cerebellar contribution to neurodevelopmental motor and social communication deficits in SMA . By delineating intrinsic and circuit - level mechanisms underlying PC degeneration and cerebellar dysfunction , our findings expand the framework of SMA pathophysiology beyond the spinal cord and implicate a new brain structure . In the future , clinical evaluations and disease modifying therapies should include the cerebellum in order to fully address the multifaceted nature of SMA and its neurodevelopmental manifestations . Sample size and rules for stopping data collection were determined by previous experience and preliminary data . All data was included if the experiment was technically sound ( perfusion , tissue preparation , staining , recordings , imaging etc . ) . The endpoints for animals were selected by previous experiments and literature references . Each experiment was replicated at least three times in different animal / autopsy tissue with the exception of p - p53 staining in human tissue due to its limited availability . The research objects were to investigate cerebellar pathology in mouse models for motor neuron diseases and autopsy tissue from SMA Type I patients . The mice were randomized to treatment group , and the investigators who assessed the behavioral , histological , USV and electrophysiological outcomes were blinded to the treatment groups . Breeding and experiments were performed in the animal facilities of Leipzig University , Leipzig , Saxony , Germany and of Columbia University , New York , NY , USA . Animal procedures were performed according to European ( Council Directive 86 / 609 / EEC ) and German ( Tierschutzgesetz ) guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals and the regional directorate ( Landesdirektion ) of Leipzig for Leipzig University , and according to National Institutes of Health Guidelines on the Care and Use of Animals and approved by the Columbia Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) for Columbia University . Mice were housed in a 12h / 12h light / dark cycle with access to food and water ad"}
