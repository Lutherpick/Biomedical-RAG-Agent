The improvements in behavior and seizure phenotype of Scn2a + / − ; Kcna1 + / − and Scn2a + / − ; Kcna1 − / − suggest that Nav1 . 2 and Kv1 . 1 may be therapeutic targets for one another and are likely playing a compensatory role for each other when one is impaired . When both channels are partially lost , there appears to be a synergistic positive effect on overall health outcomes , likely because the channels cannot overcompensate for one another and cause maladaptive changes . Lastly , another haploinsufficient Scn2a mouse model was generated by creating a point mutation at amino acid 38 , which switched Lys for Gln ( Scn2aK38Q ) ( Kotler et al . , 2023 ) . This point mutation removed the only SUMO - conjugation site in Nav1 . 2 channels ( Kotler et al . , 2023 ) . This model helped reveal that SUMOylation of Nav1 . 2 channels prolongs the decay time constant of EPSPs greater than 10 mV in amplitude , but this effect is lost in Scn2aK38Q mice . Furthermore , SUMOylation was found to impact the speed of forward and backpropagating action potentials of cortical pyramidal cells from Scn2aK38Q mice ( Kotler et al . , 2023 ) . These findings indicate that changes in SUMOylation and possibly other post - transcriptional modifications influence the observed changes in action potential back - propagation observed in Scn2a mutant mice . Most Scn2a constitutive loss of function ( LOF ) mouse models result in Scn2a haploinsufficiency and retain around 50 % of Nav1 . 2 channel expression . However , there are at least two constitutive Scn2a models that result in less than 50 % of Nav1 . 2 channel expression ; a severe hypomorph and a gene trap model ( C . Wang et al . , 2024 ) . These models both retain around 25 % or less of Nav1 . 2 channel expression . As global homozygous loss of Scn2a results in perinatal death , these models have been instrumental in exploring the consequences of severe loss of Scn2a without complete deletion . The severe Scn2a hypomorphic mouse was engineered using Crispr - Cas9 to induce a 27 - base pair frameshift in the C - terminal region of the Scn2a protein creating Scn2aΔ1898 / + ( H . - G . Wang et al . , 2021 ) , which resulted in ≤ 25 % or less of native Nav1 . 2 ( H . - G . Wang et al . , 2021 ) . Scn2aΔ1898 / + mice displayed hyperactivity and reduced anxiety - like behaviors , which is similar to other SCN2A LOF models ( Figure 3 , Supplemental Table 2 ) ( Gazina et al . , 2015 ; Léna & Mantegazza , 2019 ; Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ; H . - G . Wang et al . , 2021 ) . Additionally , Scn2aΔ1898 / + mice displayed increased social behaviors , which aligns with observations from individuals with SCN2A - related disorders ( Figure 3 , Supplemental Table 2 ) ( Sanders et al . , 2018 ) . Cultured excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons from Scn2aΔ1898 / + mice displayed both reduced voltage - gated Na + channel currents and reduced neuronal excitability , but inhibitory neurons were unchanged ( H . - G .
