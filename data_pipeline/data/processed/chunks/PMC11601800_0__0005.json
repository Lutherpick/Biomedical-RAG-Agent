Cultured excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons from Scn2aΔ1898 / + mice displayed both reduced voltage - gated Na + channel currents and reduced neuronal excitability , but inhibitory neurons were unchanged ( H . - G . Wang et al . , 2021 ) . Brain slices from these animals further revealed reduced excitatory synaptic input onto cortical pyramidal neurons ( H . - G . Wang et al . , 2021 ) . A SCN2A model created using a Tm1a trapping cassette ( Scn2a gtKO / gtKO ) reduced Nav1 . 2 expression to around 25 % that of wildtype similar to the Scn2aΔ1898 / + mouse ( Eaton et al . , 2021 ; H . - G . Wang et al . , 2021 ) . The Scn2a gtKO / gtKO displayed significant alterations in innate behaviors like nest building and grooming ( Figure 3 , Supplemental table 2 ) ( Eaton et al . , 2021 ) . These mice also had increased anxiety - like behaviors , which contrasts the behavioral findings seen in other models of Scn2a loss ( Figure 3 , Supplemental table 2 ) ( Gazina et al . , 2015 ; Léna & Mantegazza , 2019 ; Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ; H . - G . Wang et al . , 2021 ) . Adult Scn2a gtKO / gtKO mice were found to have increased neuronal excitability , which co - occurred with a higher voltage threshold in medium spiny neurons , which parallels the paradoxical hyperexcitability of cortical pyramidal neurons lacking Nav1 . 2 ( MSNs ) ( Spratt et al . , 2021 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . There was reduced expression and current outputs of some potassium channels in these mice , likely to compensate for the increased excitability induced by Nav1 . 2 depletion ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . These results indicate that changes in neuronal excitability due to Nav1 . 2 reduction are dependent on both levels of SCN2A expression and cell type . Regardless , the hyperexcitability of some neuron types in response to Nav1 . 2 loss / reduction is likely contributing to the seizure disorders experienced by individuals with LOF SCN2A mutations ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Microglia in the Scn2a gtKO / gtKO mice have morphology changes distinct from wildtype C57BL / 6N mice and may contribute to some of the noted phenotypes in these animals ( Wu et al . , 2024 ) . The Scn2a gtKO / gtKO mice further had alterations in the core clock genes and the suprachiasmatic nucleus , leading to altered sleep patterns ( Figure 3 , Supplemental table 2 ) ( Ma et al . , 2022 ) . This is the first model of SCN2A loss to evaluate sleep disturbances , although they are commonly reported in individuals with SCN2A - related disorders ( Sanders et al . , 2018 ) . Alterations in sleep architecture and regulation should be further investigated in other SCN2A models to gain further insight into Nav1 . 2 ’ s role in sleep . Improving the understanding of Nav1 . 2 ’ s role in sleep can enhance the treatment of SCN2A - related sleep disorders by identifying affected sleep cycles and mechanisms , leading to more precise treatment targets . There are multiple Scn2a models that either reduce Scn2a levels at a"}
