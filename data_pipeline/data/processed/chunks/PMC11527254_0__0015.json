These regions may activate a compensatory response to counteract the catecholaminergic imbalance caused by 6 - OHDA in the striatum . 43 Given the projection patterns of noradrenergic neurons , the increased TH levels in regions with compensation may indicate heightened noradrenergic tone , mitigating the effects of reduced dopamine levels . 44 Our brain - wide mapping enhances our understanding of regions implicated in motor and non - motor impairments in PD , extending beyond the traditional focus on nigrostriatal denervation . By leveraging machine learning and employing analytical tools from fMRI used in PD patients , 45 our 3D analysis of immunolabeling in rodent brains efficiently screens anatomically analogous regions , identifying areas relevant to different PD stages and symptoms . Moreover , our approach provides a framework for spatially resolving neuronal morphology , glial reactivity , and disease markers . Only two observational studies have explored the use of 6 - OHDA in female C57BL / 6 mice , 11 , 18 , with Masini and colleagues being the only ones considering sex differences at the histopathological level . 11 Consistent with the findings of Masini et al . , our results demonstrated a remarkable resistance of female mice to all doses of 6 - OHDA . This resistance may be partially attributed to estrogen , which is known to support elevated levels of brain - derived nerve factor . 46 It might also contribute to the lower incidence of PD in women . However , further investigation is needed to explore the neuroprotective mechanisms in female mice that underlie their resilience against the 6 - OHDA neurotoxin at the doses studied here . Based on data from this and other studies , we strongly recommend conducting a priori power calculations when designing PD research involving female mice . 11 , 18 In our study , the highest 6 - OHDA dosage progressively reduced TH protein levels in the striatum and the prevalence of TH + cells in the SNpc within 14 days . Other studies have delivered 18 or 20 μg of 6 - OHDA in the striatum , with results showing a 40 % degeneration of the SNpc in one case17 and a more severe 60 % reduction in another at 14 days . 47 Considering the timing of TH downregulation and SNpc neuron loss , selecting the appropriate 6 - OHDA dose is crucial based on the research question and histopathological endpoints . The lowest dose ( 5 μg ) causes a gradual reduction in striatal TH + expression , which may not reach significance but still leads to SNpc neuron loss by day 14 , indicating a milder injury , which could be easier to rescue . This makes it a sensitive readout for testing neurotherapeutics aimed"}
