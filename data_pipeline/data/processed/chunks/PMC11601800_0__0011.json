Scn2a R102X / + mice were identified as having absence - like seizures although appearing outwardly healthy , similar to the Planells - Cases Scn2a + / − model . At least one Scn2a R102X / + mouse was recorded using ECoG – EMG having a convulsive seizure ( Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . It would be interesting to know if the dominant negative effect identified in humans translates to the mouse model . There is also a naturally occurring Scn2a variant in the C3H mouse strain , p . V752F , that has a dominant negative effect ( Oliva et al . , 2014 ) . Shortly after the first Scn2a knockout model was published , Kearney et al . published the first Scn2a gain of function ( GOF ) model : the Scn2aQ54 mouse . In this model , the neuron - specific enolase ( NSE ) promoter drives the expression of FLAG - tagged Scn2a GAL879 – 881QQQ , where the mutation is located in the evolutionarily conserved S4 - S5 linker region of domain two ( Kearney et al . , 2001 ) . These mice displayed spontaneous seizures that originated in the hippocampus and increased in number and duration with age , eventually leading to premature death around 4 to 9 months ( Kearney et al . , 2001 ; Kile et al . , 2008 ) . High - frequency stimulation of hippocampal neurons in Scn2aQ54 mice leads to increased neuronal oscillations after discharge and spontaneous activity consistent with hyperexcitability and seizure activity ( Kile et al . , 2008 ) . Examination of hippocampi from adult Scn2aQ54 mice determined that the frequent and prolonged seizures caused significant neuronal loss and gliosis in the CA1 , CA2 , and CA3 regions of the hippocampus ( Kearney et al . , 2001 ; Kile et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , grooming , although preserved in Scn2aQ54 mice , was rigid in structure and had atypical characteristics like prolonged bouts , abnormal postures , and repetitive motions ( Kile et al . , 2008 ) . The rigid and irregular pattern of grooming in Scn2aQ54 mice could be indicative of autism - like symptomatology and may further suggest changes in neural pathways that are influencing the microstructure of innate behaviors ( H . Kim et al . , 2016 ) . A summary of Scn2aQ54 findings is provided in Figure 5 . The Scn2aQ54 mouse was originally engineered on a mixed C57BL / 6J x SJl / J ( F1 . Scn2aQ54 ) background and had a severe seizure phenotype . However , when crossed to a congenic C57BL / 6J background ( B6 . Scn2aQ54 ) , the seizure phenotype attenuated ( Bergren et al . , 2005 , 2009 ; Thompson et al . , 2017 ) . Specifically , F1 . Scn2aQ54 mice display both greater evoked activity and increased firing frequency within the hippocampus compared to the B6 . Scn2aQ54 mice , although B6 . Scn2aQ54 mice still display increased hippocampal activity compared to wildtype mice ( Thompson et al . , 2017 ) . The level of persistent sodium current and depolarized inactivation of hippocampal pyramidal cells also correlated with the changes in firing frequency and evoked potentials between the two Q54 models ( Thompson et al . , 2017 ) . The change in seizure phenotype between background strains created an avenue to investigate genetic modifiers of Scn2a - related disorders . Identifying genetic modifiers of SCN2A could provide insight into"}
