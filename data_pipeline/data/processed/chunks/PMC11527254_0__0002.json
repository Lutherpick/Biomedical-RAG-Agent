The Stanford University Administrative Panel approved all procedures and animal husbandry practices for Laboratory and Animal Care ( APLAC ) and adhered to the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . Our laboratory is also compliant with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care ( AAALAC ) standards and accredited by the AAALAC international accreditation program for the use of animals in research . Annual inspections are conducted throughout our facilities by both APLAC and AAALAC . Paper nestlets and cardboard tubes provided environment enrichment ( 1 cage change per week ) . Experimenters involved in histopathology assessment , Western blotting , and immune marker assays were blind to the treatment groups . Mice were identified with numerical IDs . Experimenters and animal caregivers were unblinded during animal surgeries and post - operative care procedures . Data analysis procedures were carried out in an unblinded fashion . A total of 215 mice were used . Before surgery , mice were acclimatized in the housing facilities for at least a week . Mice were randomized into treatment groups based on their body weight and sex . Differences in the average body weight between groups were less than 1 . 5 grams . Group housing of 4 / 5 mice per cage was done to ensure even distribution of the control vehicle and 6 - OHDA - infused mice in the same cage . To reduce stress levels , mice were handled for 4 days before surgical procedures . Mice were anesthetized using 4 % isoflurane ( Isothesia , Henry Schein Animal Health , Dublin , OH ) in a mixture of oxygen and compressed air . The toe pinch reflex confirmed full anesthetic induction . Immediately after induction , mice received a subcutaneous ( s . c . ) injection of USP solution ( 10 mL / kg ) with 5 % dextrose ( Baxter , Deerfield , IL ) and 1 mg / kg Buprenorphine SR ™ LAB ( ZooPharm ) . Mice were shaved on top of the skull and positioned on a digital stereotaxic frame ( David Kopf Instruments ) , with isoflurane maintained at 1 . 5 – 2 % throughout the surgery . Eye drops were applied to keep the cornea moisturized , and the skull surface was disinfected 3X with Betadine and 70 % ethanol solution . An 8 mm median incision above the skull was topically anesthetized twice with 5 mg / mL lidocaine ( Xylocain MPF , Fresenius Kabi , USA ) . Respiration rate , skin color , and toe - pinch reflex were monitored every 15 minutes , while normothermia was maintained through a heating pad ( WPI , ATC2000 ) connected to a feedback loop rectal probe ( WPI ) . After intracranial convection - enhanced delivery ( CED ) of 6 - OHDA or vehicle , mice were placed in recovery cages and kept warm with heating pads , with free access to 98 % water hydrogel ( Clear H2O ) for approximately 5 hours before returning to their home cage . Saline was administered s . c . every day for 5 consecutive days , with wetted food provided throughout the treatment period . Buprenorphine SR ™ LAB was administered every 48 hours to manage pain . Attrition rates ranged between 5 and 30 % depending on the sex and dose of 6 - OHDA infused . Pre - and post - surgical care was conducted per the guidelines outlined by Masini et"}
