The pathogenic SCN2A variants leading to SeLFNIE likely cause the neonatal Nav1 . 2 isoform to behave more like the adult isoform . Therefore , when the adult isoform replaces the neonatal , the biophysical properties of the Nav1 . 2 channel likely better match the developmental state of the individual and attenuate the seizure phenotype . These data demonstrate the need to study the developmental effects and trajectory of the SCN2A gene and its variants . A recent study utilized human phenotype ontology terms to evaluate potential correlations between diagnostic terms and SCN2A variants ( Crawford et al . , 2021 ) . The analysis revealed that missense SCN2A variants are largely correlated with terms like “ neonatal onset , ” “ seizures , ’ and “ no intellectual disability ” , while premature termination variants were correlated with terms like “ behavioral abnormality , ” “ autism , ” “ autistic behavior , ” and “ no seizures ’ ’ ( Crawford et al . , 2021 ) . Although ASD and ID diagnoses are primarily associated with premature termination variants , these diagnoses can still be related to missense SCN2A variants . Furthermore , if seizures , developmental delay ( DD ) , or intellectual disability ( ID ) are profound , it can be impossible to disentangle symptoms of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) from existing comorbidities , so the diagnosis is not made ( Srivastava & Sahin , 2017 ) . There is at least one reported variant , p . L1342P , where the patient presented with ID and early seizure onset but also displayed no eye contact , which is a common trait of ASD ( Begemann et al . , 2019 ) . It is possible that the comorbidities of existing diagnoses masked a potential diagnosis of ASD ( Srivastava & Sahin , 2017 ) . The phrase “ When you hear hoof beats , don ’ t look for zebras ” is often used in medicine to encourage providers to look for common diagnoses , but SCN2A - related disorders are not common ; each variant produces a unique profile of symptoms . Understanding whether a variant is gain - of - function ( GOF ) or loss - of - function ( LOF ) can guide initial treatment , but it is unlikely to capture the complete biophysical and symptom profile of every individual . SCN2A - related disorders do not occur within a binary but a spectrum of diagnoses , and the biophysical characteristics of channel variants are likely just as complex ."}
