Synapses were manually counted on the soma and on dendritic segments at two distances ( 0 – 50 μm and 50 – 100 μm ) from the soma . To minimize background - related errors , only synapses visible in at least two consecutive z - stack images were included . Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings from PCs and GCs were performed as previously described109 , 110 at P5 for PCs and P10 for both PCs and GCs . Following decapitation , the skull was opened , and the cerebellum was carefully extracted . Lateral portions of the cerebellum were trimmed to facilitate mounting in the vibratome chamber ( HM 650 V , Microm , Thermo Fisher Scientific , UK ) , which was filled with ice - cold ( ~ 4 ° C ) , oxygenated ( 95 % O2 / 5 % CO2 ) sucrose - based artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( aCSF ) containing ( in mM ) : 2 . 5 KCl , 1 . 1 CaCl2 , 4 MgCl2 , 25 NaHCO3 , 1 . 25 NaH2PO4 H2O , 10 D - glucose , and 220 sucrose . Parasagittal cerebellar slices ( 300 μm thick ) were prepared and transferred to a holding chamber containing standard aCSF , which was also used for recordings . This recording aCSF consisted of ( in mM ) : 125 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 . 25 NaH2PO4 H2O , 26 NaHCO3 , 3 D - glucose , 1 . 1 CaCl2 H2O , 1 MgSO4 7H2O , and 17 sucrose ( 310 mOsm , pH 7 . 3 , equilibrated with carbogen ) . Slices were incubated at 35 ° C for 30 minutes , then maintained at room temperature ( 21 – 23 ° C ) until use . For recordings , individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber and continuously perfused with oxygenated aCSF at room temperature . PCs were visually identified by their position in the PC layer and their large soma , as well as their distinctive morphology featuring a prominent , expansive dendritic tree extending into the molecular layer . GCs were also visually identified by their location in the GC layer and their small soma , along with a minimal dendritic arbor . Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass ( GB200F - 10 , Science Products , Hofheim am Taunus ) using a Flaming - Brown puller ( P - 97 , Sutter Instruments , CA ) to resistances of ~ 4 – 7 MΩ for PCs and ~ 8 – 10 MΩ for GCs . Pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution containing ( in mM ) : 150 K - D - gluconate , 10 NaCl , 10 HEPES , 3 Mg - ATP , 0 . 3 Na - GTP , and 0 . 05 EGTA , adjusted to pH 7 . 3 with KOH and to an osmolarity of 290 – 300 mOsm / kg H2O . Recordings were acquired in current - clamp or voltage - clamp mode using a HEKA EPC10 / 2 amplifier ( HEKA Elektronik , Lambrecht / Pfalz , Germany ) and digitized at 20 kHz with Patchmaster software ( HEKA Elektronik ) . Signals were low - pass filtered at 3 kHz ( DC – 3 kHz ; CyberAmp , Molecular Devices ) . RMP and spontaneous activity were recorded following a 10 - second baseline with no current injection .
