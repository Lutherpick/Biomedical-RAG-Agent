Fold change in transcript levels were computed relative to ACTB respectively . The FASTDock program27 was used to identify putative binding sites on each of the target proteins discussed in our study . The default set of 18 chemical probes were used , and 2000 best docked poses were retained for each probe . For each probe , the top 5 clusters were considered for next steps . CDOCKER28 was used to dock compounds C22 and C73 at the top 5 putative binding sites . For each compound , the following docking protocol was applied : at the 5 binding sites , 10 different rotamers of each compound were generated using OpenBabel and docked while keeping the protein receptor region fixed and represented by a grid28 . Then , the 10 poses were rescored by applying the Fast Analytical continuum Treatment of Solvation ( FACTS ) model29 , which accounts for the desolvation penalty associated with each pose at the binding site . The FACTS - rescored docking scores were averaged across all poses . This protocol was independently repeated 10 times at each site for both compounds , thereby yielding an average dock score computed from a total of 100 poses for each compound . The site with the most favorable ( most negative ) averaged FACTS - rescored dock score was considered the top binding site , and the best binding pose at that site exhibited the highest ( most negative ) FACTS - rescored dock score . We generated 2D diagrams of protein - ligand interactions using PlexView ( https : / / playmolecule . org / PlexView / ) . The stability of the FICD inhibitors at the previously obtained binding poses was probed using MD simulations . The CHARMM molecular simulation program30 was used to perform these simulations . Receptors with C22 or C73 bound were placed in a bath of explicit water models ( TIP3P model ) and counter ions ( Na + or Cl − ) were added to neutralize the charge of the solvated system . The following scheme was used to perform all MD simulations performed in this study . First , the energy of the solvated system was minimized to eliminate bad contacts introduced during system preparation . During minimization , which included 2000 steps of steepest descent minimization followed by 1000 steps of ABNR minimization , the receptor and compound ( ligand ) heavy atoms were harmonically restrained to their initial poses with a force constant of 10 kcal / mol / Å2 . Next , an equilibration step was carried out under constant temperature ( 310 K ) and volume conditions for 1 ns . The previous restraints were retained . Third , the restraints were reduced to 5 kcal / mol / Å2 but were still imposed on the receptor and ligand heavy atoms , and the next phase of equilibration was carried out under constant temperature and constant pressure ( 1 atm ) for another 1 ns . A penultimate phase of constant temperature and pressure ( NPT ) equilibration was initiated with restraint forces reduced to 1 kcal / mol / Å2 for 1 ns . This was followed by another 1 ns of NPT equilibration with a very small restraint of 0 . 1 kcal / mol / Å2 . After these phases of equilibration , the production simulation was run for 5 ns under NPT conditions without any restraints . The nonbonded interactions within the system were truncated at 12 Å"}
