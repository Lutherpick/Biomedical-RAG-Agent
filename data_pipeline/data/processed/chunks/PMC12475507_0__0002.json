The filament is advanced until a firm resistance is felt , indicating that it has reached the MCA and caused occlusion . Postoperatively , the mice are placed in a recovery chamber that is maintained at a warm temperature to prevent hypothermia . 5 mice received sham ‐ operation ; sham ‐ operated animals underwent the same anesthesia and exposure of arteries without MCA occlusion [ 21 , 22 ] . Infarcts resulting from pMCAO were analyzed following treatment with 2 , 3 , 5 ‐ triphenyltetrazolium chloride ( TTC ) 0 . 3 mice were euthanized through cervical dislocation 24 h post ‐ ischemic induction . The brains were carefully excised and sectioned into 1 mm thick coronal slices using a brain matrix ( LEAGNE BIOTECHNOLOGY , DK0005 ) . These slices were then stained with 1 % TTC in 1 % PBS at room temperature for 10 min . The stained coronal sections were digitized . Prior to stroke , the mice underwent continuous EEG monitoring for a duration of 24 h . During the first hour post ‐ stroke , the mice were in the recovery phase from anesthesia , and no EEG monitoring was conducted . Subsequently , continuous EEG monitoring was performed for a duration of 5 h ( Figure 1C ) . The EEG signals were acquired and analyzed using the KEDOUBC recording system ( model RHD1024A , provided by Kedou ( Suzhou ) Brain ‐ Computer Technology Co . Ltd ) at a 1 kHz sampling rate . EEG signals underwent preprocessing using MNE ( v1 . 7 . 0 ) , PyTorch ( v2 . 2 . 2 ) , NumPy ( v1 . 24 . 3 ) , SciPy ( v1 . 10 . 1 ) , and scikit ‐ learn ( v1 . 4 . 2 ) with a 1 – 40 Hz band ‐ pass filter and down ‐ sampled to 256 Hz . Then , the EEG signals were divided into 5 ‐ s segments , with each segment consisting of 1280 data points ( 5 s × 256 Hz ) . Each segment was labeled as either stroke ( label = 0 ) or healthy ( label = 1 ) , and these segmented signals were used for training and testing the model . In this experiment , we chose EEGNet , a lightweight convolutional neural network designed specifically for multichannel EEG signals . The model was configured with the default hyperparameters including a temporal filter length of F1 = 64 , spatial ‐ depth multipliers D = 2 , and dropout rate p = 0 . 5 [ 23 ] . The PyTorch implementation of EEGNet is publicly available at https : / / github . com / aliasvishnu / EEGNet . EEGNet extracts spatial and time ‐ frequency features via a series of convolutional operations . This architecture is well ‐ suited for processing high ‐ dimensional EEG signals , making it ideal for this study . Initially , the EEG data collected during the 5 h of the Hyper ‐ acute phase were fed into the EEGNet model for binary classification ( stroke vs . healthy ) . A 7 ‐ fold cross ‐ validation [ 24 ] was employed , where one mouse dataset was used as the test set and the remaining six as the training set . This process was"}
