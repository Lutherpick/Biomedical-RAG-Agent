Two recent studies describe pathologic ficd mutations with clinical implications because of dysregulated ER proteostasis21 , 22 . Homozygous FICDR371S expression in human patients is linked to infancy - onset diabetes mellitus and neurodevelopmental impairments21 , whereas homozygous FICDR374H expression leads to progressive motor neuron degeneration and peripheral neuropathy22 . Both mutations cause FICD to lose its deAMPylation activity while slightly increasing or retaining AMPylation activity . This results in excessive BiP AMPylation impairing UPRER signaling with the concomitant accumulation of misfolded and aggregated polypeptides . In this study , we develop a fluorescence polarization - based high - throughput screen to discover inhibitors of FICD - mediated protein AMPylation . We employ this platform to screen 84 , 480 small molecules obtained from two separate small molecule libraries and identify a total of 81 putative FICD inhibitors . Using orthogonal in vitro and cell - based assays , we identify two compounds ( C22 and C73 ) that significantly inhibit endogenous FICD - mediated BiP AMPylation while weakly inhibiting BiP deAMPylation . C22 and C73 stably bind to the dimer interface of endogenous FICD and prevent the dimeric deAMPylase competent FICD from adopting an AMPylase competent conformation . We show that both compounds are non - cytotoxic small molecules that do not trigger the UPRER and are effective against pathogenic FICD mutants in - vitro . Finally , we demonstrate that C22 improves proinsulin folding and secretion in pancreatic β cells by reducing basal BiP AMPylation . Our study establishes FICD as a druggable target and suggests that targeting FICD may benefit multiple protein misfolding diseases . Human His6 - tagged 45 – 457FICD constructs ( WT , E234G , R371S and R374H ) and Caenorhabditis elegans His6 - tagged 187 – 457FIC - 1 were cloned into pETDuet - 1 plasmids . The plasmids were transformed and expressed in E . coli BL21 or BL21 - DE3 cells ( Stratagene ) , and grown in TB medium containing 50 μg / mL of kanamycin to an optical density 0 . 8 . − 1 . Protein expression was induced by adding 0 . 4 mM IPTG for 16 – 20 hours at 18 ° C . Thereafter , bacteria were collected by centrifugation and bacterial pellets were sonicated in lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 250 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , 1x protease inhibitor cocktail , pH 8 . 0 ) . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15 , 000 × g for 30 mins . Supernatants were poured over nickel resin pre - equilibrated with lysis buffer . Thereafter , the resin was washed with wash buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 250 mM NaCl , 30 mM imidazole , pH 8 ) . His - tagged proteins were eluted in elution buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 250 mM NaCl , 350 mM imidazole , pH 8 ) . Fractions containing FICD were verified for purity by Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate - Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) , pooled , and dialyzed in a dialysis buffer overnight ( 50 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 0 ) . Human His6 - SUMO - tagged BiP was expressed and purified as described previously23 . Briefly , pSMT - WT BIP , kindly gifted by Dr . Liu ( Virginia Commonwealth University ) , was expressed in E . coli BL21 cells grown in TB medium containing 50 μg / mL of kanamycin to an optical density of 0 ."}
