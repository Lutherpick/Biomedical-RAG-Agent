A higher F1 score implies a higher precision and recall of the model , which is usually considered a sign of better model performance . F1 = 2 × Precision × RecallPrecision + Recall 5 . ROC Curve and AUC : the Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve indicates the model ' s ability to discriminate between classes , with the area under the curve ( AUC ) providing a single value indicating performance . AUC values close to 1 indicate excellent discrimination . 6 . Standard Deviation ( std ) : standard Deviation is an important concept in statistics used to measure the degree of dispersion of results . A smaller standard deviation indicates a more centralized result , indicating a more stable model . t ‐ Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ( t ‐ SNE ) [ 25 ] is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize high ‐ dimensional data . It is particularly useful for revealing complex patterns in data . For this experiment , t ‐ SNE was applied to the output of the final layer of the EEGNet model to visualize the extracted features . In this study , 20 mice were used , of which 17 underwent electrode implantation , with 2 mice dying post ‐ surgery . Among the 15 mice that received successful electrode implantation , 10 underwent pMCAO surgery , 2 of which died within 6 h , and 1 was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage upon post ‐ mortem examination ; 5 mice underwent sham surgery , with 1 dying post ‐ operation . Thus , the dataset for this experiment consisted of EEG recordings from 7 pMCAO mice and 4 sham ‐ operated mice . Moreover , 3 mice that underwent pMCAO surgery were euthanized 24 h later by cervical dislocation for TTC staining , with the infarct regions shown in Figure 1B . EEG features from mice during the entire hyperacute phase were extracted using the EEGNet algorithm , and a deep learning model was constructed based on these features . During the training process , the loss curve gradually decreased with an increasing number of epochs and eventually stabilized , indicating that the model had successfully converged . To further assess the stability and reliability of the model , we performed seven ‐ fold cross ‐ validation , evaluating the model ' s performance on different data subsets to ensure its generalizability and diagnostic accuracy . Through the comprehensive analysis of the entire hyperacute ‐ phase EEG data , we evaluated the model ' s performance using several key metrics , including ACC ( 0 . 979 ± 0 . 122 ) , AUC ( 0 . 977 ± 0 . 031 ) , precision ( 0 . 964 ± 0 . 124 ) , recall ( 0 . 977 ± 0 . 175 ) , and F1 score ( 0 . 966 ± 0 . 022 ) . These metrics were used to assess the model ' s ability to differentiate between stroke and healthy states over the course of the hyperacute phase , providing a robust measure of the model ' s diagnostic performance and stability ( Figure 3 ) .
