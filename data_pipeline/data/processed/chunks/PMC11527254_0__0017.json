We also examined the expression and phosphorylation levels of kinases ( DAPK1 , GSK - 3β , and AKT ) that regulate apoptosis . 61 , 62 DAPK1 activity was increased in the striatum of 6 - OHDA - treated mice at day 7 , potentially indicating ongoing apoptosis due to excitotoxicity , which is associated with neuronal cell death in both in vivo and in vitro models . 33 In contrast , GSK - 3β and AKT were not activated , preventing them from influencing neuronal degeneration and survival . In summary , this study provides a detailed characterization of the 6 - OHDA mouse model , incorporating comprehensive catecholaminergic mapping , three different time points and dosages of 6 - OHDA , and the inclusion of both male and female mice . Traditional histopathological methods effectively detected dose - dependent , progressive striatal TH + fiber loss and SNpc neurodegeneration , while also revealing resilience in female mice . These findings were complemented by an innovative approach for quantifying brain - wide iDISCO + / LSFM data . Specifically , differential TH immunolabeling was spatially resolved through voxel - wise analyses and carefully evaluated with FDR correction and precise measurements of TH + cell and fiber densities in the most affected regions . This study also highlights the early immune response preceding neuronal cell death in the striatum and SNpc , revealing a distinct cytokine / chemokine signature to that observed in PD patients . Additionally , we identified increased DAPK1 activity , which may drive excitotoxicity in SNpc neurons . Our findings offer valuable insights into the 6 - OHDA mouse model , delineating brain - wide histopathology and the biochemical signaling profile in the nigrostriatal pathway . Furthermore , our methodologies can be applied to other animal models of neurodegenerative diseases , potentially advancing our understanding of disease processes and the development of new therapeutic strategies ."}
