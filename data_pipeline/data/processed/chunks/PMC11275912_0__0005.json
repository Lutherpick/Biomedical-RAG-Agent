The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10000x g for 10 mins at 4 ° C . The supernatant was carefully removed and used in a Bicinchoninic Protein Assay ( BCA ) to assess protein concentrations . 4 × Laemmli sample loading buffer ( BioRad ) was added to the supernatant and the mixture was boiled for 5 mins at 95 ° C . 10 μg of supernatant was loaded onto two separate 10 % SDS - PAGE gels and resolved . Proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes and blocked with 5 % ( w / v ) milk or Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) in Tris - buffered Saline supplemented with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) tween - 20 ( TBST ) . One of the membranes was blotted with mouse anti - Thr AMP ( 17G6 , Biointron ) while the other with anti - mouse BiP ( Proteintech ) . Anti - mouse HRP - conjugated GAPDH ( Proteintech ) or mouse anti - α - Tubulin ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) were used as loading controls . Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies ( 1 : 1000 , diluted in TBST with 5 % BSA or milk ) at 4 ° C overnight and then incubated with HRP - conjugated - secondary antibody ( 1 : 5000 ) for 1 hour at RT . The membranes were incubated with ProSignal Dura ECL Reagent ( Prometheus ) at RT for 2 mins and imaged using Invitrogen iBright FL1500 Imaging system . Signals were quantified using ImageJ2 software26 . Min6 cells were grown to 80 % confluency and then fed fresh GM6 supplemented with C22 ( 20 μM ) or DMSO for 16 hours . Thereafter , both cells and media were collected , and cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail . Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 mins @ 12 , 000 rpm . Before electrophoresis , samples were boiled at ( 95 ° C in SDS - gel sample buffer under either nonreducing or reducing ( 200 mM DTT ) conditions , and then resolved either on straight nonreducing 15 % SDS - PAGE in Tris - Glycine buffer or reducing 4 – 12 % gradient NuPage gels . Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted with mouse mAb anti - rodent proinsulin ( Novus Biologicals ) , rabbit anti - BiP ( Thermo ) and mouse anti - AMPylated - BiP ( 17G6 , Biointron ) . Mouse anti - β actin ( Proteintech ) was used as protein loading control . Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies ( 1 : 1000 , diluted in TBST with 5 % BSA ) at 4 ° C overnight and then incubated with HRP - conjugated - secondary antibody ( 1 : 5000 ) for 1 hour at RT . 3 - [ 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ] - 2 , 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay was performed to determine the effect of compounds on the viability of HeLa ( ATCC - CRM - CCL2 ) , A549 ( CCL - 185 ) , SK - N - SH ( HTB - 11 ) cells and neonatal murine cardiomyocytes .
