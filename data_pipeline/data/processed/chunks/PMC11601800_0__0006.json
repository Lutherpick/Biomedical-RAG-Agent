Improving the understanding of Nav1 . 2 ’ s role in sleep can enhance the treatment of SCN2A - related sleep disorders by identifying affected sleep cycles and mechanisms , leading to more precise treatment targets . There are multiple Scn2a models that either reduce Scn2a levels at a specific age or induce tissue - specific changes in Scn2a expression . Many of these models utilize Cre - driver lines to induce conditional deletion of Scn2a in specific tissue and cell types ( Gould & Kim , 2021 ; Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ; Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ; Spratt et al . , 2019 , 2021 ; Suzuki et al . , 2023 ; Tamura et al . , 2022 ; Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ; H . - G . Wang et al . , 2021 ) . Other models utilize unique approaches like short - hairpin RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides ( M . Li et al . , 2023 ; Nunes & Kuner , 2018 ) . Expressing shRNAs on postnatal day 21 enabled the deletion of Nav1 . 2 in olfactory bulb granule cells ( ObGC ) , which enabled the investigation of Nav1 . 2 ’ s involvement in odor discrimination ( Nunes & Kuner , 2018 ) . Nav1 . 2 channels are expressed along the cell surface and dendritic spines obGCs , and removal of Scn2a from obGCs was found to impair rapid and accurate odor discrimination ( Figure 4 , Supplemental Table 2 ) ( Nunes & Kuner , 2018 ) . Impaired odor discrimination was likely due to inhibition of synaptically connected mitral cells , diminished GABA release , and reduced granule cell spiking , which were all consequences of Nav1 . 2 deletion in obGC ( Nunes & Kuner , 2018 ) . Currently , this is the only model to identify impaired odor discrimination in Scn2a mutant mice ; investigations utilizing the Planells - Cases Scn2a + / − mouse have not revealed a difference in odor discrimination between mutant mice and their wildtype counterparts ( Eaton et al . , 2021 ; Léna & Mantegazza , 2019 ) . These conflicting findings suggest that a threshold of Nav1 . 2 is necessary for rapid and accurate odor discrimination . Another unique method to reduce Scn2a expression relied on antisense oligonucleotides ( ASO ) . An ASO was injected into the ventricles of 2 to 3 - month - old Rbp4 - Cre mice to both truncate Scn2a and create Scn2a insufficiency and selectively label L5 pyramidal neurons ( M . Li et al . , 2023 ) . The Scn2a ASO mice displayed reduced sociability and increased hyperactivity and anxiety - like behaviors ( Figure 4 , Supplemental table 2 ) . These mice also lost innate nest building , similar to data from Scn2a gtKO / gtKO mice ( Figure 4 , Supplemental table 2 ) ( M . Li et al . , 2023 ) . Ca2 + transient currents were also reduced in Scn2a ASO mice , which decreased spontaneous cortical somatosensory neuronal firing and pairwise co - activation ( M . Li et al . , 2023 ) . This study wanted to utilize the Scn2a ASO mouse model as a proxy for identifying the consequences of premature truncating variants ( PTV ) . However , Scn2a haploinsufficiency is not generated until mice are between 2 and 3 months of age and neural networks have been fully"}
