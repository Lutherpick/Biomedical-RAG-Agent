S9A - C ) , highlighting the non - cell - autonomous origin of this defect . These improvements were cerebellum - specific as AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN treatment did not ameliorate spinal cord pathology , including p53 - mediated motor neuron death , NMJ denervation , and loss of proprioceptive synapses ( Fig . S9D - K ) . Thus , SMN deficiency triggers PC death through mechanisms that involve cell - autonomous p53 activation and are independent from degeneration of parallel fiber boutons . Lastly , we asked whether PC degeneration contributes to neurodevelopmental motor and vocalization deficits in SMA mice . We found that selective SMN restoration in PCs moderately improved gross motor performance as assessed by righting reflex and body posture assays until P4 , while it had essentially no effects on weight gain and survival in SMA mice ( Fig . 7H – J and Fig . S9L ) , indicating a cerebellar involvement in the early postnatal motor phenotype of SMA . We also investigated the effects of AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN treatment on the vocalization deficits of SMA mice by performing USV experiments . We found that selective restoration of SMN in SMA PCs increased the number of USV calls per 3 minutes at the P5 and P7 time points relative to untreated SMNΔ7 mice ( Fig . 7K – L ) , re - establishing the inverted U - shape profile that is characteristic of normal early postnatal social development but strongly blunted in SMA mice . In contrast , other acoustic features such as call duration , frequency jumps , and peak frequency were not improved by AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN gene delivery in SMA mice ( Fig . S9M - O ) . These findings demonstrate that cell - autonomous degeneration of PCs induced by SMN deficiency contributes to neurodevelopmental deficits in SMA mice . Motor impairments have historically taken center stage in SMA research and have previously been linked to the dysfunction of spinal motor circuits . Following the advent of disease modifying therapies , which extend survival and significantly , yet partially , improve motor function in SMA patients , there has been an increasing recognition of the clinical relevance of cognitive and social deficits as well as the involvement of neuronal circuits in the brain as potential disease contributors . In this context , our study highlights a novel role for cerebellar pathology in motor and social communication deficits in SMA . The cerebellum plays a critical role in motor coordination , cognition , and social behavior . By integrating multiple lines of evidence for PC degeneration , circuit - level cerebellar disruption , and new neurodevelopmental phenotypes from a severe mouse model of the disease with analysis of post - mortem tissue from Type I patients , we highlight the cerebellum as a clinically relevant , previously underappreciated site of SMA pathology . Our study identifies PC degeneration as a signature of SMA that is conserved across mice and humans and establishes PCs ( ~ 35 % loss ) as the second most vulnerable neuronal population after motor neurons ( ~ 50 % loss ) in SMA patients . The identification of selective PC reduction and hypoplasia of vermal lobules VI and VII in end - stage severe SMA mice complements previous reports of PC pathology in the hemispheres of severe SMA mice42 , 43 and in SMA"}
