Recently , a Long Evans rat Scn2a + / − model was engineered using CRISPR - Cas9 to disrupt exon 5 of Scn2a ( Kastner et al . , 2024 ) , which generates a frameshift and presumed LOF . On a novel choice - wide behavioral association test , the Scn2a + / − rats displayed impairments in spatial alternation - related behaviors compared to wildtype controls ( Kastner et al . , 2024 ) . Currently , an Scn2a + / − prairie vole is being characterized ( Perry Spratt 2020 ) . Prairie voles have social structures more similar to humans than rats or mice and may better emulate the social changes seen in human SCN2A disorders . The Scn2a + / − prairie vole model is being engineered using CRISPR - Cas9 mutagenesis to introduce a premature stop codon within the first and third coding exons of the Scn2a gene ( Perry Spratt 2020 ) . Preliminary data from the early generations of the Scn2a + / − prairie voles indicate impaired dendritic excitability similar to the Scn2a + / − mouse models ( Perry Spratt 2020 ) . This may be the first evidence that dendritic deficits caused by loss of Scn2a are conserved across species . Loss of Nav1 . 2 leads to many changes in neuronal activity that can be specific to cell type and developmental stage . Severe loss of Nav1 . 2 can lead to paradoxical increases in the excitability of mature cortical - striatal and neocortical pyramidal neurons while also impairing dendritic excitability ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ; Spratt et al . , 2021 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Nevertheless , loss of Nav1 . 2 in immature Scn2a + / − pyramidal neurons leads to reduced excitability similar to the effects seen in obGCs and somatosensory cortical neurons ( M . Li et al . , 2023 ; Nunes & Kuner , 2018 ; Spratt et al . , 2019 ) . Since distinct brain regions and cell types differentially contribute to many behaviors , and the functional impact of Nav1 . 2 loss differs based on neuronal cell type and developmental stage , this could be a source of apparently conflicting findings in SCN2A models . When conducting behavioral assays in Scn2a mutant mice , it is important to consider what cell type or brain region is involved in the behavior being assessed since the functional role of SCN2A may be variable across paradigms . It is also paramount that when electrophysical consequences of Nav1 . 2 loss are investigated , the developmental stage and cell type are reported , as that information can drastically change interpretation of results . Another factor that could contribute to the inconsistent behavioral findings is the age of the mice being tested . At least one study to date found that behavioral phenotypes attenuate as Scn2a + / − mice age , and multiple studies have identified electrophysiological alterations that are only present during the first postnatal week ( Léna & Mantegazza , 2019 ; Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ; Spratt et al . , 2021 ) . Nav1 . 2 is known to play a significant role in adult animal ’ s excitatory neurons but may also influence inhibitory neurons"}
