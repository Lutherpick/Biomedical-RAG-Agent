The functional output of PCs is shaped by the activity of excitatory and inhibitory cerebellar neurons . Therefore , we investigated whether cerebellar circuit dysfunction could contribute to alter PC output in SMA mice . To do so , we used antibodies against vesicular GABA transporter ( VGAT ) as a marker for inhibitory synapses originating from basket , stellate , and Golgi neurons36 as well as neighbouring PC cells50 , 51 ( Fig . S3A ) . To visualize excitatory synapses , we used antibodies against vesicular glutamate transport proteins ( VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 ) as markers of parallel fiber terminals originating from GCs and climbing fibers from the inferior olive52 . During development , parallel fibers transition from expressing VGLUT2 to VGLUT1 after the first postnatal week53 . Consistent with this , we observed small parallel fiber synapses exclusively expressing VGLUT1 on the soma and proximal dendrites of PCs , whereas larger VGLUT2 + climbing fiber synapses were found contacting the soma and primary dendritic shafts in P10 mice ( Fig . S3B ) . We investigated the apical regions of the vulnerable lobules VI / VII , which exhibited PC death , and the resistant lobule III , which has no detectable PC loss ( Fig . 1A , F ) . VGLUT1 + parallel fiber synapses were reduced by ~ 30 % on the soma and ~ 50 % on both proximal ( 0 – 50 μm from the soma ) and distal ( 50 – 100 μm ) dendrites of PCs in the vulnerable lobules VI and VII of SMNΔ7 mice at P10 ( Fig . 3A , B ) , whereas resistant PCs in lobule III showed no reduction ( Fig . S4A , B ) . Inhibitory VGAT + synapses were also selectively reduced albeit to a lesser extent ( ~ 30 % decrease onto the soma and proximal dendrites but unchanged onto distal dendrites ) in vulnerable PCs of lobules VI / VII ( Fig . 3C , D and Fig . S4C - D ) . In contrast , VGLUT2 + synapses from climbing fibers were spared or only mildly affected in PCs of vulnerable and resistant lobules of SMNΔ7 mice ( Fig . 3E , F and Fig . S4E - F ) . To test whether synaptic loss is limited to the severe form of SMA , we investigated synaptic density onto PCs in the milder Smn2B / - mouse model and found that all three types of synapses were unaltered at disease end - stage ( Fig . S4G , H ) . Together , these findings reveal a substantial loss of excitatory parallel fibers and a milder reduction of inhibitory synapses onto vulnerable PCs in severe SMA mice . Next , we investigated the impact of synaptic dysregulation on neurotransmission by recording intracellular excitatory post - synaptic currents ( EPSCs ) from PCs following extracellular stimulation of parallel fibers ( Fig . 3G ) . We normalized the EPSC amplitude of the PCs to the stimulation current injected into the parallel fibers . EPSCs from PCs of the vulnerable lobules VI / VII in SMNΔ7 mice were reduced by ~ 50 % ( Fig . 3H , I ) , consistent with dysfunction and loss of VGLUT1 + synapses from parallel fibers ( Fig . 3B ) .
