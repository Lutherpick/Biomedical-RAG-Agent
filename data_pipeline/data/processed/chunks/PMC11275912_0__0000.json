This ATP - dependent process is catalyzed by a dedicated set of enzymes called AMPylases . AMPylases can be broadly classified into two groups : enzymes that possess a highly conserved fic - domain ( Fic ) 2 , 3 , catalyzing the transfer of AMP , and non - Fic enzymes , such as SelO and DrrA , that catalyze AMPylation through a Fic - independent mechanism4 – 6 . This study focuses on the development of small molecular inhibitors specific for the AMPylase FICD , which regulates the Endoplasmic Reticulum ( ER ) heat shock 70 protein chaperone Binding immunoglobulin Protein ( BiP ) 7 – 9 . Human FICD , also referred to as Huntingtin yeast - interacting partner E ( HYPE ) localizes to the ER lumen and is N - glycosylated on Asn2758 . Structurally , FICD consists of a single transmembrane domain ( residues 24 – 44 ) , two TPR domains TPR1 ( residues 105 – 135 ) and TPR2 ( residues 140 – 170 ) , and the conserved , catalytic Fic domain ( residues 215 – 432 ) joined to the TPR motifs by a short linker ( residues 170 – 215 ) ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . The TPR motifs dictate FICD ’ s target recruitment7 , 10 – 13 . The Fic core comprises the conserved catalytic loop and the flap14 . The Fic core harbors the highly conserved Fic motif H363F ( I / V ) DGNGRT ( S / A ) R , while the flap ( residues 311 – 324 ) is involved in positioning of the target residues . FICD possesses an auto - inhibitory helix ( α - inh ) containing the inhibitory motif ( T / S ) V ( A / G ) IE234N11 , 15 . FICD catalyzes AMP transfer to target hydroxyl group ( s ) via the conserved His363 in the Fic motif , which acts as a base to attack the phosphodiester bond of an ATP molecule , resulting in AMP transfer and the concomitant release of a pyrophosphate group ( PPi ) . Unlike most enzymes , FICD is bi - functional and catalyzes AMPylation as well as the removal of AMP from modified proteins ( deAMPylation ) using a single catalytic site7 , 13 , 16 . The switch between AMPylation and deAMPylation states involves changes in enzyme oligomerization / monomerization , and an exchange of metal ions coordinating FICD ’ s active site16 . Cellular signals that facilitate this switch remain poorly characterized but may involve changes in ER calcium levels17 . FICD regulates the ER stress response via reversible BiP AMPylation7 , 13 , 18 . Published work is consistent with the model that under unstressed conditions , FICD AMPylates and generates a pool of primed ( AMPylated ) yet chaperoning - impaired BiP . The emergence of ER stress , however , results in rapid BiP deAMPylation , concomitant with the induction of the unfolded protein response ( UPRER ) 19 , 20 . Two recent studies describe pathologic ficd mutations with clinical implications because of dysregulated ER proteostasis21 , 22 . Homozygous FICDR371S expression in human patients is linked to infancy - onset diabetes mellitus and neurodevelopmental impairments21 , whereas homozygous FICDR374H expression leads to progressive motor neuron degeneration and peripheral neuropathy22 .
