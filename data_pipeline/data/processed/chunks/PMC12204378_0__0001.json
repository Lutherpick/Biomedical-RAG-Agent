Here , we identify a selective , cerebellar - autonomous pathology restricted to specific lobules associated with motor and social communication behaviors in a severe mouse model of SMA . Cerebellar pathology comprises progressive p53 - dependent death of select pools of Purkinje cells ( PCs ) as well as cerebellar circuit dysfunction which includes disruption of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto PCs leading to their abnormal firing . We show that these changes contribute to motor deficits and to a newly identified social phenotypic impairment in ultrasonic vocalization ( USV ) . Furthermore , analysis of post - mortem tissue from Type I SMA patients confirmed both induction of p53 and loss of PCs in the cerebellum , strengthening the clinical relevance of our findings for human pathology . Together , our results identify cerebellar pathology as a key contributor to the neurodevelopmental disruption of motor and communication behaviors in SMA . To study cerebellar pathology in SMA , we examined the vermal region in the SMNΔ7 mouse model of severe SMA36 , 48 . Sagittal cross - sections of the vermis were incubated with antibodies against the Purkinje cell protein 2 ( PCP - 2 ) , a specific marker of PCs49 , followed by confocal imaging and quantification of the overall cerebellar structure and the number of PCs . This analysis revealed abnormal foliation , reduced size of the molecular , granular , and white matter layers as well as the total area of lobules VI and VII in the cerebellar vermis of SMNΔ7 mice at disease end - stage ( P10 ) compared to healthy littermates ( Fig . 1A – E ) . Importantly , SMNΔ7 mice showed selective loss of PCP - 2 + PCs in the apical regions of lobules VI and VII ( Fig . 1A , F ) . Longitudinal analysis revealed progressive degeneration of SMA PCs in lobules VI and VII starting at P4 and preceding foliation defects and cerebellar hypoplasia at P7 ( Fig . 1A , G , H ) . Double labeling with PCP - 2 and calbindin , another marker for PCs49 , confirmed that the observed changes were due to PC degeneration rather than selective downregulation of PCP - 2 in severe P10 SMA mice ( Fig . S1A ) . To determine whether PC loss is also a feature of SMA in humans , we quantified PCs in vermal cerebellar regions of 15 control individuals and 7 SMA Type I patients ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Although the identity of specific lobules could not be determined from cerebellar autopsy tissue , we found an overall 35 % reduction in PC density in the cerebellum of SMA patients relative to controls ( Fig . 1I , J ) . Importantly , the observed reduction of PC number was independent of the postmortem interval ( PMI ) and age of individuals ( Fig . 1K ) . To determine whether PC death is a shared feature of motor neuron diseases , we investigated the cerebellum of milder Smn2B / - SMA mice as well as SOD1 - G93A and Ighmbp2NMD - 2J mice as models of familial ALS and SMA with respiratory distress type 1 ( SMARD1 ) , respectively . None of these models exhibited PC loss or cerebellar alterations at disease end - stage ( Fig . S1B – G ) , indicating that PC degeneration and cerebellar hypoplasia are specific features of severe SMA that are not present in other motor"}
