Signals were low - pass filtered at 3 kHz ( DC – 3 kHz ; CyberAmp , Molecular Devices ) . RMP and spontaneous activity were recorded following a 10 - second baseline with no current injection . Only cells with a RMP of − 45 mV or lower , AP amplitudes of at least 30 mV , and the ability to repetitively fire 10 or more AP were included in further analysis as previously reported111 , 112 . Passive membrane properties were assessed in current - clamp mode by holding the cells at − 80 mV membrane potential to inhibit spontaneous activity and injecting brief ( 300 ms ) alternating current steps : 4 pA increments for PCs and 1 pA for GCs . Frequency - current ( F – I ) relationships were determined by injecting 1 - second depolarizing current steps ( 10 pA for PCs , 5 pA for GCs ) . Excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) were evoked by stimulation of parallel fibers for PCs or mossy fibers for GCs while holding the membrane potential at − 70 mV . To isolate excitatory transmission during parallel fiber stimulation , 10 μM bicuculline was added to the bath solution to block GABAA receptor - mediated inhibition . The stimulation pipette , filled with recording aCSF , was positioned in the molecular layer for parallel fiber or granular layer for mossy fiber simulation . The stimulus intensity was adjusted to elicit EPSCs with amplitudes between 200 – 600 pA to avoid action currents . Stimulation consisted of five pulses at 200 Hz for parallel fibers or 100 Hz for mossy fibers , with a duration of 200 μs per pulse . Data were analyzed offline using Patchmaster software ( HEKA Elektronik ) . USV experiments were performed at the Mouse NeuroBehavior Core of Columbia University . To elicit USV emission , neonatal mouse pups were gently separated from the dam and placed in a small plastic container lined with a 0 . 5 cm layer of fresh bedding . The cage lid was immediately and gently placed back , to avoid agitating the dam and the remaining pups in the nest . The container with the isolated pup was immediately placed inside a sound - attenuating chamber ( Med Associates ) to minimize background noise and environmental disturbances . USVs were recorded using an ultrasound - sensitive microphone ( Avisoft UltraSoundGate condenser microphone CM16 , Avisoft Bioacoustics ; frequency range : 10 – 180 kHz ) connected to a PC running Avisoft Recorder software . After each 3 - minute recording session , the pup was marked to prevent repeated handling on the same day and returned to the nest . This procedure was repeated until all pups in the litter were tested . Recordings were performed on postnatal days P3 , P5 , P7 and P9 . USV recordings were analyzed using Avisoft SASLab Pro software . Only frequencies above 35 kHz were analyzed . Spectrograms were generated using a Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) with a 512 - length , frame size 100 % , 50 % overlap , and a Hamming window . Calls were manually labeled and parameters such as call number , duration , peak frequency , and inter - call interval were extracted for statistical analysis . In line with the Reduction principle of the 3Rs Guidelines in animal research , we minimized the number of animals used for USV analysis by reusing"}
