In addition , the downregulation of potassium channels was found to contribute to the hyperexcitability of medium spiny neurons cultured from Scn2agtKO / gtKO mice ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . When pimaric acid , a global potassium channel agonist , was applied to Scn2agtKO / gtKO medium spiny neurons , their excitability was largely normalized to that of wildtype animals ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , the application of 4 - trifluoromethyl - L - phenylglycine , a specific Kv1 . 1 agonist , improved the hyperexcitability phenotype of Scn2agtKO / gtKO medium spiny neurons , which indicates that Kv1 . 1 may be a potential target for the treatment of some SCN2A related seizures ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Additionally , Scn2a deletion improved the survival of Kcna1 − / − mice ( Mishra et al . , 2017 ) . Lastly , RNA sequencing data from Scn2agtKO / gtKO whole mouse brains indicate that multiple voltage - gated potassium channels are downregulated in response to the loss of Nav1 . 2 ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Taken together , these data indicate that Nav1 . 2 and voltage - gated potassium channels likely have a dynamic relationship that may prove useful from a therapeutic perspective . As evidenced by the growing literature of Scn2a mouse models , voltage - gated potassium channels are likely important in SCN2A - related disorders . Thus far , Kv1 . 1 , Kv1 . 2 , Kv7 . 2 , Kv8 . 2 , and Kv9 . 2 have all been implicated in modulating Nav1 . 2 channel activity and / or expression ( Bergren et al . , 2009 ; Indumathy et al . , 2021 ; Kearney et al . , 2006 ; Mishra et al . , 2017 ; Nadella et al . , 2022 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Potassium channel modulation should continue to be explored as a therapeutic target for the seizure treatment of individuals with pathogenic SCN2A variants ( Berecki et al . , 2022 ; Lauxmann et al . , 2018 ) . However , it is important to note that the decision to block or activate specific potassium channels to attenuate seizures would likely depend on each patient ’ s specific variant . There have been multiple attempts to develop a viable and safe genetic therapy to alleviate SCN2A - related disorders . One such attempt explored cis - regulation therapy ( CRT ) by using a dCas9 fused to a transcriptional co - activator ( Tamura et al . , 2022 ) . This method allows CRISPR activation ( CRISPRa ) to increase the expression of the functional wildtype Scn2a allele in both Scn2a + / − and Scn2a + / kl mice ( Supplemental Table 1 ) ( Tamura et al . , 2022 ) . The rAAV - CRISPRa - based treatment restored typical excitability patterns in Scn2a + / − cortical neurons compared to wildtype ( Tamura et al . , 2022 ) . Furthermore , the treatment was not shown to induce seizures or lead to phenotypic abnormalities in the animals ( Tamura et al . , 2022 ) . CRISPRa rescue and upregulation of Scn2a was then utilized to recover an appropriate vestibular ocular reflex"}
