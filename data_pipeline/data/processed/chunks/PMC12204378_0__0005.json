Conversely , SMA mice exhibited pronounced USV deficits , including an approximately 50 % reduction in call number at P5 and P7 ( Fig . 4B , C ) , displaying a stagnant trajectory reminiscent of that observed in ASD mouse models65 , 66 . Further analysis of the USV acoustic properties in P5 SMA mice revealed a consistent reduced call rate over the time of recording , shorter call durations , smaller frequency jumps , and an overall higher frequency compared to control littermates ( Fig . 4D – G ) , suggesting short , high - pitched communication with reduced vocal complexity . In contrast , the frequency range ( bandwidth ) , average of the maximum amplitude per call and maximum amplitude during 100 calls remained unchanged in SMA mice ( Fig . 4H – J ) , indicating a normal vocalization without fatigue despite severe motor deficits . Overall , these findings reveal neurodevelopmental social deficits in the acquisition of social communication behaviors in SMA mice . The cerebellum plays a crucial role in processing proprioceptive information and modulating motor output , which are both strongly affected in SMA mouse models and patients5 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 34 , 35 , 67 . This raises the question whether cerebellar degeneration is a consequence of spinal sensory - motor circuit pathology in SMA . To address this , we first aimed to rescue SMA specifically in motor neurons by exploiting a previously established mouse model for conditional rescue of SMA ( SMARes ) harboring two homozygous human transgenes ( SMN2 and SMNΔ7 ) , one Smn null allele ( SmnKO ) , and one Cre - inducible Smn allele ( SmnRes ) with a switch cassette flanked by loxP sites in opposing orientation68 . In the absence of Cre recombinase , the phenotype of the SMARes model is similar to that of SMNΔ7 mice because the mouse / human SmnRes hybrid allele produces predominantly a truncated , non - functional SMN protein . However , Cre - mediated genomic recombination of the switch cassette leads to the expression of full - length , functional SMN21 , 26 , 27 , 68 . We and others have previously demonstrated that SMARes mice harboring Choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) - Cre exhibit rescue of pathology in motor neurons ( SMA + SMNChAT - Cre ) 21 , 26 , 27 . The rescue of the pathology in motor neurons in of SMA + SMNChAT - Cre mice did not rescue the cerebellar pathology including the lobule area , PC number , and density of VGLUT1 + parallel fiber terminals in vulnerable lobules VI / VII ( Fig . 5 ) , demonstrating that the cerebellar alterations are independent of motor neuron pathology . To address whether sensory defects contribute to the cerebellar pathology in SMA , we restored SMN in proprioceptive neurons using a parvalbumin ( PV ) - Cre driver in SMA + SMNPV - Cre mice , which exhibit rescued proprioceptive function21 . We leveraged the fact that developing PCs in lobules VI / VII do not express parvalbumin until the second postnatal week , in contrast to the early expression of both PCP - 2 and calbindin ( Fig . S6 ) confirming previously reports in wild - type mice69 . Consequently , SMN cannot be restored in these vulnerable PCs prior to their degeneration in SMA + SMNPV - Cre mice"}
