Delaying inhibitor addition by 15 mins attenuated the decline in BiP AMPylation , while a 30 min delay in C22 or C73 addition had no effect on BiP AMPylation levels ( Figure 3C – D ) . Taken as a whole , these results support a model in which C22 and C73 are acting during the transition phase when the enzyme is adopting an AMPylation - competent conformation . This could occur through at least two mechanisms : First , C22 and C73 could stabilize FICD in a deAMPylation - competent conformation and prevent the transition . Second , the compounds could prevent AMPylation - competent FICD from engaging in BiP AMPylation . FICD is a bifunctional enzyme preferentially adopting a deAMPylase - compentent conformation in the absence of stress19 , 20 . To further characterize the mode of action of compounds C22 and C73 , we tested whether these molecules could inhibit FICD - mediated BiP deAMPylation in intact cells . Our assay was based on the finding that starvation mediated BiP AMPylation in A549 cells was quickly reversed upon incubating the cells in complete medium ( Figure 3E ) . The incubation of nutrient depleted cells in GM for 5 minutes was sufficient to significantly reduce AMPylated BiP levels , with a maximal approximately 60 % decrease occurring after 15 mins in complete medium ( Figure 3F ) . The addition of both C22 and C73 delayed but did not prevent BiP deAMPylation from occurring ( Figure 3G – H ) . These results indicate that C22 and C73 are weak modulators of FICD - mediated BiP deAMPylation in intact cells . C22 , and its sodium salt , C73 , are both halogenated salicylanilide molecules . To identify C22 analogs with improved FICD inhibition activity , we tested several commercially available analogues using our well - established FP assay ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , the benzamide moiety was intolerant to most structural changes that we evaluated . The removal of the 3 - and 5 - iodo functional groups ( compound 2 ( C51 ) ) , resulted in an approximately 40 - fold reduction in potency ( Table 1 , Figure 8A ) . The incorporation of a 5 - chloro - 2 - hydroxy benzamide ( compound 3 ( C32 ) ) , modestly improved inhibition potency compared to C51 ( Table 1 , Figure 4A ) . Adding an unsubstituted benzamide ( compound 4 ( C50 ) ) , and 3 - nitro - 2 - methyl benzamide , ( compound 5 ( C52 ) ) resulted in complete loss of potency ( Table 1 , Figure 4A ) . While only a limited number of benzamide analogues were tested , compounds 2 – 5 indicate that the 2 - hydroxyl moiety is essential for compound potency , and halogenated substitutions at the 3 - and 5 - positions are required for compounds to be effective FICD inhibitors . Of all six tested analogs , compound 6 ( C34 ) was of particular interest . The replacement of racemic nitrile with a carbonyl moiety while retaining the 3 - and 5 - iodo groups resulted in C34 exhibiting significantly improved potency compared to compounds 2 – 5 , and a similar potency compared to our benchmark compounds , C22 and C73 ( Table 1 , Figure 4A ) . In cell - based assays , we further observed that C34 promoted a concentration -"}
