To date , a direct role for cerebellar dysfunction to the clinical phenotypes of motor neuron diseases has not been established . Here , we provide initial evidence linking cerebellar pathology to neurodevelopmental motor and social vocalization deficits in neonatal SMA mice . We show that selective restoration of SMN in PCs improves righting reflexes and posture in SMA mice at early postnatal developmental stages preceding the onset of motor neuron and proprioceptive synapse degeneration22 , 24 , which may obscure cerebellar - driven contributions at later times . Moreover , since disrupting parallel or climbing fiber input to PCs impairs righting reflexes in neonates82 – 86 and our viral mediated SMN restoration approach did not improve synaptic connections in the parallel fiber – PC circuit , our results may have underestimated the cerebellar contribution to motor dysfunction in SMA . Consistent with a pathogenic role of cerebellar dysfunction in SMA , we also observed transient PC hyperactivity in lobules VI and VII — a phenomenon previously associated with motor deficits in ALS87 and more broadly linked to impaired motor behavior and tremor88 , 89 . Additionally , PC loss and hypoplasia of vermal lobules VI and VII have been linked to hypotonia , ataxia , impaired motor coordination and balance in both mice and humans60 , 90 – 93 . Together , these findings support the contribution of cerebellar dysfunction to early motor deficits in SMA . A key advance of our study is the discovery of social communication deficits and the direct contribution of cerebellar dysfunction to this novel neurodevelopmental phenotype in SMA mice , which implicate a broader range of neural circuits beyond those controlling spinal motor neuron networks in the disease manifestations . We report that SMA mice display profound vocalization deficits as demonstrated by alterations in USV patterns during early postnatal development . USVs are well established readouts for social communicative behavior and not simply by - products of motor activity in neonatal mouse models94 , 95 . In agreement , the stagnant USV trajectory in SMA mice parallels that of ASD models , which show similar communication deficits without motor impairments65 , 66 . Accordingly , the absence of changes in maximum sound volume or bandwidth , along with the relative sparing of head and ventral neck muscles involved in swallowing , speech , and laryngeal movement in SMA mice96 – 98 support the conclusion that the observed USV impairment is independent from the neuromuscular phenotype . In ASD mouse models , compelling evidence implicates the cerebellum — particularly lobules VI and VII — as major contributors to USV deficits . 37 , 61 – 63 , 93 . In agreement with this , we demonstrate that selective restoration of SMN in PCs leads to a significant yet partial correction of the USV phenotype in SMA mice . However , while the number and the inverted - U shape developmental profile of USV calls are specifically improved by PC - specific SMN rescue , the observation that several other acoustic features remain defective implicates additional neuronal circuit deficits . Considering the well - established influence of excitatory synapses from parallel or climbing fibers on USVs in early postnatal pups82 – 84 , one possibility is that loss of these synaptic inputs , which is not corrected by selective SMN rescue in PCs , contributes to the incomplete rescue of vocalization deficits in SMA mice ."}
