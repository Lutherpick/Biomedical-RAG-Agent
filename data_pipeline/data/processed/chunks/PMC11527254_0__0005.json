The blots were imaged using the Sapphire Molecular Imager and analyzed with Azure Spot software ( Azure Biosystems ) . Gel analysis was conducted using three control samples in each gel . Protein expression was normalized to a loading control — α - tubulin or glyceraldehyde 3 - triphosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) . Protein markers were analyzed for phosphorylation status using phosphorylation state - specific antibodies , and the phosphorylated protein level was reported as a ratio relative to the total protein level . Mice were deeply anesthetized , followed by intracardial puncture and perfusion with 1xPBS . Ventral midbrains were collected , and the SNpc was sub - dissected . The 48 - plex mouse ProcartaPlex immunoassay ( Thermo Fisher Scientific cat . n . : EPX480 - 20834 - 901 ) was performed following the manufacturer ’ s instructions and as published . 23 Tissue was weighed and homogenized with a 1 : 10 ratio in lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , Halt protease inhibitor cocktail ( 1 : 100 ) , phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride ( 1 : 100 ) , Triton X - 100 ( 1 : 100 ) , and NP - 40 ( 1 : 100 ) . The protein concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and samples were diluted to obtain a protein concentration of 2 μg / μL . Samples were run in singlicate , and mean fluorescence intensity values obtained from 6 - OHDA groups were transformed as log2 fold changes relative to the vehicle group for comparison . Immunolabelling and iDISCO + procedures followed published protocols25 with slight modifications . Antibodies used are listed in Table S1 . Ten mice were infused with 6 - OHDA ( 20 μg ) , and 8 mice were infused with the vehicle . All mice were infused in the right dorsal striatum . Two weeks later , mice were anesthetized ( isoflurane 4 % ) and intracardially perfused with PBS , followed by 4 % PFA in PBS . Brains were post - fixed overnight , washed 3 times in PBS with constant orbital shaking at room temperature ( RT ) , and then dehydrated with methanol ( 45 - minute incubations with 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , and 100 % methanol in PBS ) . After 1 hour in 100 % methanol , brains were chilled to 4 ° C and transferred to a solution of dichloromethane : methanol ( 66 : 33 ) overnight at RT . Brains were washed 4 times in 100 % methanol and bleached in methanol containing 5 % hydrogen peroxide . Brains were rehydrated by reversing the methanol dilution series , washed for 1 hour with PBS and 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , permeabilized ( incubated in PBS containing 20 % DMSO , 0 . 3 M glycine , and 0 . 16 % Triton X - 100 for 2 days ) , washed 2x with PTwH ( PBS , 0 . 2 % [ v / v ] Tween - 20 , 0 . 01 % [ w / v ] heparin , and 0 . 02 % sodium azide [ w / v ] ) , blocked ( incubated in PBS containing 6 % donkey serum and 10 % DMSO for 4 days ) and incubated in blocking buffer containing the primary antibody ( Table S1 ) for 7 days . After repeated washes for three days"}
