Human cerebellum tissue was cryoprotected with a 15 % sucrose solution for at least 2 h until the tissue sank to the bottom of the tube . Afterwards , the tissue was transferred to a 30 % sucrose solution and stored at 4 ° C overnight . The next day , the cerebellum tissue was embedded in Sakura Tissue Tek O . C . T . Compound and frozen in 2 - Methylbutan cooled with liquid nitrogen . Tissues were cut at a Leica CM3050 S cryostat into 20 μm serial transverse sections at − 20 ° C and subsequently stored at − 80 ° C . Human cerebellar sections were incubated for 20 min in Polyscience L . A . B . solution for antigen retrieval at room temperature . Afterwards they were washed 3 times with PBS and blocked in 5 % normal donkey serum in 0 . 3 % PBS - T for 90 min . They were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies against PCP2 as PC marker and p - p53 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) at 4 ° C overnight . The following day , after 6 washes of 10 min with PBS , 3 h incubation with secondary donkey antibodies coupled to Alexa488 , Cy3 or Alexa647 ( Jackson labs ) diluted at 1 : 1000 in PBS - T were performed . After 6 times 10 min PBS washes , the slides were cover - slipped with glycerol : PBS ( 3 : 7 ) medium . For immunostaining of murine cerebellum and spinal cords , mice were perfused with PBS and 4 % PFA following 4 % PFA post - fixation overnight at 4 ° C . On the following day , the brain and spinal cord were removed and washed in PBS . The cerebellum was then separated from the rest of the brain and split at the mid sagittal plane of the vermis . The hemispheres were removed , and half of the vermis was used for immunohistochemistry . The detailed protocol used for spinal cord dissection and identification of the lumbar L1 spinal segment has been previously reported108 . The vermis or L1 segment was then embedded in warm 5 % agar and serial transverse sections ( vermis = 70 μm , spinal cord = 75 μm ) were cut at the vibratome ( Leica VT1000S ) . The sections were blocked with 5 % normal donkey serum in PBS with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ( PBS - T ; pH 7 . 4 ) for 90 min . Then the primary antibodies in blocking solution ( Supplementary Table 2 ) were added overnight at room temperature . The next day , after the sections were washed 6 times for 10 minutes in PBS - T , 3 h incubation with secondary donkey antibodies coupled to Alexa488 , Cy3 or Alexa647 ( Jackson labs ) diluted at 1 : 1000 in PBS - T were performed . Subsequently the sections were washed 6 times for 10 min in PBS and were mounted on slides with glycerol : PBS ( 3 : 7 ) medium . For immunostaining of NMJs , mice were sacrificed or perfused and the muscle was dissected , immediately post - fixed with 4 % PFA for 2 h and transferred into PBS . The next day , single muscle fibers were teased and washed 3 times"}
