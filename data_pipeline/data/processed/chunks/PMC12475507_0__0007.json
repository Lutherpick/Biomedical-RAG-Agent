The study by van Meenen LCC et al . identified alterations in theta and alpha power ; a combination of the weighted phase lag index and relative theta power provided the most accurate diagnostic performance , achieving a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 84 % [ 18 ] . Fareshte demonstrated that combining four Lasso ‐ selected EEG lead ‐ band pairs , including alpha , low beta , and high beta bands , with clinical information in deep learning models can achieve high diagnostic accuracy , with an AUC of 0 . 86 , sensitivity of 76 % , and specificity of 80 % [ 8 ] . These results suggest that EEG may be useful to improve the diagnosis of large acute ischemic stroke , findings that might be useful for pre ‐ hospital applications . However , few diagnostic studies to date have exclusively focused on patients within the critical 6 h window after symptom onset , a period that is pivotal for effective treatment of LVO stroke [ 13 , 14 , 28 ] . Additionally , while there are numerous reports from animal studies on EEG changes following acute stroke , most focus on spectral changes ; different studies lack standardized metrics for spectral changes , which diminishes their specificity and diagnostic value [ 12 , 29 , 30 , 31 ] . In this study , we utilized the pMCAO mouse model to simulate LVO stroke and employed deep learning methods to confirm the significant value of EEG signals in identifying hyper ‐ acute stroke . This study clearly confirms that EEG data holds significant diagnostic value in the identification of hyper ‐ acute stroke . The deep learning model based on EEG data showed excellent recognition capability , with classification accuracy consistently above 95 % across all time intervals . The AUC values approaching 1 demonstrated the model ' s strong consistency and reliable performance in distinguishing stroke from healthy states . Additionally , the small standard deviations indicated stable and robust predictions across different time periods . These evaluation metrics and excellent performance suggest that the EEG ‐ based deep learning model has the potential to serve as a biomarker for identifying LVO stroke . In this study , EEG data from the first hour following stroke onset were not recorded , as this period overlaps with the recovery phase from anesthesia . To minimize potential interference from anesthesia ‐ induced alterations in cortical activity , EEG acquisition was initiated only after the animals resumed stable , spontaneous behavior . This approach ensured that the recorded signals reflected authentic post ‐ stroke neural dynamics . Early diagnosis of stroke is critical for improving treatment outcomes , as therapeutic efficacy is highly time ‐ dependent [ 32 ] . Notably , even without access to data from the earliest time window ( 0 – 1 h ) , the model demonstrated excellent classification performance within the 1 – 1 . 55 h interval , achieving high accuracy and discriminability despite the expected subtlety of EEG changes at such an early stage . This result suggests that the model is capable of detecting ischemic events shortly after onset . Future work may aim to collect EEG data during the first hour post ‐ stroke to determine whether detection can"}
