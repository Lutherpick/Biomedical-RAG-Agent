At the highest tested compound concentration ( 10 μM ) , we observed up to 80 % decrease in BiP AMPylation levels for both C22 ( Figure 1H ) and C73 ( Figure 1I ) . These results confirm C22 and C73 as potent cell permeable FICD inhibitors . Our cell - based assays showed that using compounds C22 and C73 at concentrations of 10 μM led to efficient FICD inhibition . To determine whether C22 or C73 are cytotoxic at micromolar doses , we incubated HeLa , A549 , and SK - N - SH cells with increasing concentrations of each compound . We found that both compounds were well tolerated by all three immortalized cell lines , exhibiting LD50 ( Lethal Dose50 ) values between 88 – 190 . 3 μM ( Supplementary Table 3 , Supplementary Figure S5A – C ) . Repeating the experiments using primary mouse cardiomyocytes , a cell type particularly sensitive to small - molecule toxicity43 – 45 , ( Supplementary Figure S5D ) confirmed the limited cytotoxicity of compounds C22 and C73 . Since FICD is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum ( UPRER ) 7 – 9 , 46 , we next assessed whether C22 and C73 induce UPRER signaling . We performed quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) to evaluate expression levels of genes regulated by the UPRER . We found that while the treatment with Tunicamycin , a known ER stressor47 , 48 , induced a strong UPRER , the exposure to C22 and C73 at inhibitory concentrations did not change the expression of selected genes involved in regulating ER homeostasis , inflammation , and apoptosis including FICD , BiP , Activating Transcription factor 4 ( ATF4 ) , spliced ( s ) and total ( t ) X - box Binding Protein 1 ( XBP1 ) , Activating Transcription Factor 6 alpha ( ATF6A ) , CASPASE4 and CASPASE6 , respectively49 ( Supplementary Figure S5E ) . We also assessed CHOP protein levels in cells exposed to FICD inhibitors , which confirmed that neither FICD inhibitor promoted enhanced CHOP expression ( Supplementary Figure S5F ) . These results provide strong evidence that FICD inhibitors C22 and C73 are tolerated across cell types at concentrations well outside the therapeutic window and do not disturb UPRER - mediated cellular processes . In unstressed cells , FICD is sought to reside preferentially in a deAMPylation - competent dimeric conformation . During our cell - based experiments , we exposed cells before and during nutrient depletion stress to FICD inhibitors . Thus , the compounds were likely interacting with both the deAMPylation - competent FICD dimer and , upon nutrient shortage , the AMPylation - competent FICD monomer . To understand whether FICD inhibitors show a preference for monomeric or dimeric FICD , we assessed their binding affinities to apo , dimeric WT FICD ( PDB ID : 4U04 ) and monomeric FICDL258D ( PDB ID : 6I7J ) by in - silico docking . First , we identify all potential binding sites in the WT dimeric FICD using FASTDOCK50 . Then , we used CDOCKER28 to dock the FICD inhibitors to these binding cavities and rank the top 5 binding sites for both C22 and C73 . ( Supplementary Figure 6A ) . Two of these putative binding sites were particularly interesting : the smaller , potentially more flexible dimeric interface11 ( site # 1 ) , and residues near the Tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR - II ) domain ( site #"}
