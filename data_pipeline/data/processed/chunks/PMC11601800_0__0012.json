The change in seizure phenotype between background strains created an avenue to investigate genetic modifiers of Scn2a - related disorders . Identifying genetic modifiers of SCN2A could provide insight into why individuals with identical mutations do not present clinically with matching symptomology and severity . Genetic screening of both background strains identified loci on chromosomes 11 and 19 , Modifier of epilepsy 1 ( Moe1 ) and Modifier of epilepsy 2 ( Moe2 ) , respectively ( Bergren et al . , 2005 ) . These loci accounted for around 80 % of the observed differences in seizure susceptibility between the two strains ( Bergren et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , the SJI background strain carries doubleridge ( dblr ) , a transgene - induced mouse mutation , in chromosome 19 , which is also the location of the Moe2 locus ( MacDonald et al . , 2004 ) . The dblr mutation reduces the expression of Dickkopf - 1 ( Dkk1 ) , a Wnt signaling inhibitor , and has been related to increased seizure events ( MacDonald et al . , 2004 ) . However , reducing levels of Dkk1 in B6 . Scn2aQ54 mice by crossing them with Dkk1 + / − mice did not increase seizure susceptibility or incidence ; thus , Dkk1 is unlikely to be the genetic modifier of seizure severity between the two background strains of Scn2aQ54 mice ( MacDonald et al . , 2004 ) . Fine mapping of chromosome 19 determined that the Moe2 locus within the dblr region is 21 . 8kb upstream of Dkk1 ( Bergren et al . , 2009 ) , thus supporting previous data indicating that Dkk1 was not the modifier increasing seizure susceptibility . However , careful chromosome mapping identified twenty - four other potential genetic modifiers within the Moe2 locus ( Bergren et al . , 2009 ) . Sequencing of the candidate genes uncovered non - synonymous coding sequence polymorphisms in the potassium channel gene Kcnv2 ( voltage - gated potassium channel subfamily V , member 2 / Kv8 . 2 ) and the transcription factor Smarca2 ( SWI / SNF related matrix - associated , actin - dependent regulator of chromatin , subfamily a , member 2 ) ( Bergren et al . , 2009 ) . Ultimately , Kcnv2 was determined to be the strongest functional candidate of Moe2 locus involvement in the seizure phenotype differences observed between the F1 . Scn2aQ54 and B6 . Scn2aQ54 mice ( Bergren et al . , 2009 ) . Knowing how genetic modifiers influence the Scn2aQ54 mouse phenotype helps elucidate how similar mutations can lead to disparate seizure and symptom profiles of individuals with SCN2A - related disorders . The pore - forming subunit of the T - type calcium channel Cav3 . 1 , Cacna1g , has been identified as a genetic modifier of seizure severity between the B6 . Scn2aQ54 mice and the F1 . Scn2aQ54mice ( Calhoun et al . , 2016 ) . Cacna1g is located in the Moe1 locus . Elevation of Cav3 . 1 correlated with increased spontaneous seizure activity , while a decrease in Cav3 . 1 correlated with decreased seizure activity ( Calhoun et al . , 2016 ) . Cacna1g could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Scn2a - related epilepsies that do not respond to sodium or potassium"}
