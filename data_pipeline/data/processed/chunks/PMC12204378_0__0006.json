S6 ) confirming previously reports in wild - type mice69 . Consequently , SMN cannot be restored in these vulnerable PCs prior to their degeneration in SMA + SMNPV - Cre mice . Notably , the rescue of the proprioceptive pathology of SMA + SMNPV - Cre mice did not rescue any aspect of the cerebellar pathology ( Fig . 5 ) , effectively uncoupling the observed cerebellar alterations from proprioceptive dysfunction . Taken together , the persistence of cerebellar pathology despite SMN rescue in motor or proprioceptive neurons indicates that PC and parallel fiber bouton degeneration occurs independently of spinal sensory - motor circuit defects in SMA mice . To investigate potential intrinsic drivers of this cerebellar vulnerability , we examined whether p53 - mediated mechanisms — previously implicated in motor neuron degeneration in SMA mouse models18 – 20 , 24 , 70 — also contribute to PC loss . First , we first performed a longitudinal analysis of p53 expression in the cerebellum of SMNΔ7 mice using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy . While control littermates did not show any p53 expression in the cerebellum as expected , SMNΔ7 mice exhibited strong , time - dependent nuclear accumulation of p53 in PCs ( Fig . 6A – C ) . Importantly , the proportion of p53 + SMA PCs in lobules VI / VII increased from nearly none at P1 to ~ 50 % at P4 , coinciding with the onset of PC degeneration ( Fig . 1H and Fig . 6B ) . In contrast , resistant PCs of lobule III ( and other lobules ) showed p53 expression only at disease end - stage ( ~ 20 % ) ( Fig . 6C ) . In addition to p53 upregulation18 , 20 , phosphorylation of the amino - terminal transactivation domain of p53 including serine 18 ( S18 ) ( corresponding to serine 15 in human p53 ) is a necessary event to induce death of motor neurons in SMA mice18 , 19 . Therefore , we investigated the expression of p53 phosphorylated at S18 ( p - p53S18 ) by immunohistochemistry with phosphor - specific antibodies in the cerebellum of SMNΔ7 mice . Notably , the expression of p - p53S18 + was confined to vulnerable PCs in lobules VI / VII and was absent in resistant PCs in lobule III at P10 ( Fig . 6D , E ) . Moreover , the majority ( ~ 80 % ) of PCs from the intermediate Smn2B / - mouse model of SMA was p53 + but did not express p - p53S18 at disease end - stage ( Fig . S7A - D ) , in agreement with the lack of PC death in this model ( Fig . S1F , G ) . These results identify nuclear accumulation of p - p53S18 as a marker for degenerating PCs in SMNΔ7 mice , akin to the situation in SMA motor neurons18 . To evaluated whether p53 activation contributes to PC loss in human SMA pathology , we performed immunohistochemistry experiments with p - p53S15 antibodies and well - preserved cerebellar sections from a control individual and a Type I SMA patient . While we found no pp53S15 immunoreactivity in control tissue , nuclear p - p53S15 accumulation was detected in small degenerating PCs of the SMA cerebellum ( Fig . 6F and Fig . S7E ) . Consistent"}
