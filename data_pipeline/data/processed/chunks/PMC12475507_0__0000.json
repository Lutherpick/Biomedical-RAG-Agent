LVO often leads to extensive brain tissue damage , clinically manifesting as acute neurological deficits , frequently accompanied by severe impairments in motor , cognitive , and sensory functions [ 2 , 3 ] . Endovascular thrombectomy ( EVT ) is the standard and most effective treatment for stroke caused by LVO [ 3 , 4 ] . However , the efficacy of EVT is highly time ‐ dependent , and only a minority of hospitals are EVT ‐ capable [ 3 , 5 , 6 ] . As a result , stroke care systems must rapidly identify patients with LVO and transport them to EVT ‐ capable centers as quickly as possible . Unfortunately , current clinical assessments face challenges , including inconsistencies in diagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness [ 7 , 8 ] . While established modalities like computed tomography angiography , magnetic resonance angiography , and conventional angiography can provide reliable diagnoses , they are not feasible for prehospital use due to their time ‐ consuming nature and the need for specialized equipment [ 1 , 9 ] . Thus , enhancing tools for early LVO detection , particularly in prehospital care , remains a crucial objective . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) is a promising technique for prehospital stroke triage [ 10 , 11 , 12 ] , which can immediately detect changes in brain function following the onset of brain ischemia , before cell death . Multiple studies have found moderate to high diagnostic accuracy of EEG for LVO detection [ 8 , 13 , 14 ] . However , the challenges of transforming EEG from a hospital ‐ based seizure diagnostic instrument into a prehospital stroke diagnostic are numerous . One of the major challenges in utilizing EEG signals for clinical diagnosis is the efficient interpretation and automated recognition of the data [ 10 ] . Currently , EEG data analysis predominantly relies on manual labeling and traditional algorithms , which are not only time ‐ intensive but also require skilled professionals for accurate interpretation . Furthermore , existing studies are limited by the absence of EEG ‐ specific biomarkers capable of reliably assessing early ‐ stage stroke [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] . These limitations significantly hinder the practical application of EEG in the rapid assessment of acute stroke in emergency settings [ 16 , 18 ] . Consequently , there is an urgent need for the development of more advanced algorithms to automate EEG data processing and accurately identify stroke ‐ specific features . By improving the performance of these algorithms , the diagnostic utility of EEG in clinical practice can be significantly enhanced , reducing human bias and enabling early , accurate detection of acute stroke . This , in turn , will provide stronger support for clinical decision ‐ making . A further challenge in developing diagnostic algorithms is the necessity for a sufficiently large and reliable dataset [ 19 ] . In clinical settings , accurately capturing the time of stroke onset , particularly within the first 6 h , remains difficult [ 20 ] . Current research highlights a lack of diagnostic studies focusing specifically on this critical early time window [ 14 ] . To address this limitation , our study employs a permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery ( pMCAO ) mouse model to simulate the stroke"}
