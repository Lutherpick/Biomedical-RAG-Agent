After these phases of equilibration , the production simulation was run for 5 ns under NPT conditions without any restraints . The nonbonded interactions within the system were truncated at 12 Å after the application of potential switching function starting at 10 Å . Particle Mesh Ewald ( PME ) was used to treat long range electrostatics with κ = 0 . 32 Å − 1 , order = 4 , grid size of 0 . 8 – 1 . 2 Å and force errors tolerance of 10 − 5 . SHAKE31 was employed to constrain the distances of hydrogen - heavy atom bonds after performing hydrogen mass repartitioning32 . The temperature was regulated using a Langevin thermostat with a friction coefficient of 5 ps − 1 . Pressure , in the constant pressure simulations , was isotopically regulated using a MC barostat with volume changes attempted every 25 steps . The integration timestep was set to 2 fs . Force field parameters of the receptor ( s ) , TIP3P water model and counter ions were taken from the CHARMM36 force field33 – 35 . Parameters for the FICD inhibitors were obtained using the CGenFF program ( v 2 . 5 . 1 ) 36 . The corresponding rtf files are shared as supplementary files S1 and S2 . Endpoint free energy calculations using the MM / PBSA technique were carried out using the snapshots generated from the production phase of the simulations . Only the last 4 . 5 ns of the 5 ns of the production was used to obtain snapshots every 40 ps . We used the single - trajectory protocol of MM / PBSA where the energy terms associated with the receptor - ligand complex , the receptor , and the ligand were all derived from the same snapshot as opposed to individual simulations conducted for each of these systems separately . The molecular mechanical ( MM ) energy terms and the surface area ( SA ) terms were determined using the CHARMM program . The SA term was used to compute the nonpolar component of the solvation energy by coupling it with a surface tension value of 0 . 005 kcal / mol / Å 2 . The Poisson - Boltzmann ( PB ) framework was used to compute the polar component . Delphi37 was used for the PB calculations . The internal and external dielectric values were set to 1 and 80 , respectively . The salt concentration was set to 0 outside the solute ’ s ( receptor , ligand or the complex ) molecular surface , thereby reducing the Poisson - Boltzmann equation to Poisson equation only . The molecular surface itself was drawn using a solvent probe radius of 1 . 4 Å to emulate water . The solute atoms ’ charges and radii were taken directly from the set used in the MD simulations . Statistical Analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism ( version 10 . 2 . 2 ) software . Unpaired t - tests with Welch ’ s correction and 2 - way ANOVA tests were performed . Figure legends specify the utilized tests for each data panel . p values were computed to determine statistical significance . If a p - value is less than 0 . 05 , it is flagged with one star ( * ) . If a p - value is less than"}
