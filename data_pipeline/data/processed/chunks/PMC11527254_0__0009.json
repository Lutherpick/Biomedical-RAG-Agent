TH + fiber density was defined as ( ( # of voxels segmented as TH + fibers ) / ( total # of voxels in the cluster ) ) * 100 . 32 Clusters were considered valid if an unpaired , two - tailed t - test demonstrated a significant difference in TH + cell or fiber density between hemispheres or treatment groups . Sunburst plots were made using Flourish , and 3D models of valid clusters were created using DSI - Studio . For region - wise cell density measurements , the ABA was warped to tissue space ( 10 μm resolution ) , scaled to full resolution , and multiplied by the binary cell segmentation to enable 3D counting with respect to region labels . Statistical analyses of lesion extent , western blots , and cytokines / chemokines were performed using GraphPad Prism software . ROUT ( Q = 1 % ) was used to identify statistical outliers , which were subsequently excluded from analyses . Dunnett ’ s multiple comparison test was used to compare each 6 - OHDA group or timepoint to the vehicle condition , while Šídák ’ s multiple comparison test was applied to compare 6 - OHDA and vehicle groups for Luminex markers on each day evaluated . Values of p < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Male mice were unilaterally infused in the dorsal striatum with 20 μg of 6 - OHDA or the vehicle control , and 14 days later , their brains were fixed , immunostained for TH , optically cleared with iDISCO + , and imaged in 3D using LSFM . We utilized UNRAVEL to automate brain - wide mapping of TH immunolabeling and expanded its functionality to quantify changes in catecholaminergic cell groups and TH + fiber prevalence following 6 - OHDA treatment . For this , autofluorescence images were registered with an iDISCO + / LSFM - derived average template brain aligned to the Allen brain atlas ( ABA ; CCFv3 2017 ) , and TH - immunofluorescence ( TH - IF ) images underwent background subtraction and warping to atlas space for voxel - wise statistical analysis ( Fig . S1 ) . Out of the 9 , 040 , 331 voxels analyzed using a 2 × 2 ANOVA design , 5 , 787 , 716 voxels displayed significance for main effects and / or interactions , prompting further examination through voxel - wise post hoc t - tests . The resulting p - value maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR method to identify clusters of significant voxels . These clusters were partitioned based on their overlap with dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell groups . TH + cell density measurements were taken within these regions , and fiber densities were assessed outside these regions ( Figs . S1 and S2 ) . For validation , clusters were transformed to full - resolution tissue space for precise cell or fiber density measurements using segmentations from Ilastik . Clusters with significant differences between conditions ( either side or treatment group ) for these measurements were considered valid . As anticipated , TH - IF was reduced in the SNpc and regions it innervates ( Fig . 2 – 3 and Fig . S2 , S3 , and S5 ) .
