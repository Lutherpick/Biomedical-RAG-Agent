Several pharmacotherapies have been tried in Scn2a mouse models to attenuate symptoms associated with pathogenic variants . One such drug is CX516 , a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors ( Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ) . Intraperitoneal injection of CX516 at least 10 minutes prior to behavioral tasks at multiple doses was shown to reduce hyperactivity phenotypes seen in Scn2a + / − mice ( Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ) . The greatest effect was seen at the highest dose , 40 mg / kg , and the treatment did not appear to negatively affect wildtype C57BL / 6J mice ( Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ) . Other drugs tested in Scn2a mutant mice have been utilized to attenuate seizures . These drugs include Ranolazine and GS967 / PRAX - 562 , which both inhibit persistent sodium current ( Anderson et al . , 2014 ) . Both of these drugs reduced seizure frequency in F1 . Scn2aQ54 mice with GS967 / PRAX - 562 being more effective ( Anderson et al . , 2014 ) . GS967 / PRAX - 562 further improved survival of F1 . Scn2aQ54 mice and prevented hilar neuron loss and protected the mice from induced seizures in the maximal electroshock paradigm ( Anderson et al . , 2014 ) . However , GS967 / PRAX - 562 suppressed hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting in these mice , which could lead to the alteration of behavioral phenotypes , like spatial learning ( Comba et al . , 2015 ; Ramírez - Amaya et al . , 2001 ) . Further data from mice treated with GS967 / PRAX - 562 are needed to evaluate potential adverse effects . Although these sodium channel blockers are effective in treating the GOF seizure phenotype of F1 . Scn2aQ54 mice , they would likely be an ineffective , if not harmful , treatment of seizures for individuals with LOF SCN2A variants ( H . J . Kim et al . , 2020 ; Miao et al . , 2020 ; Oyrer et al . , 2018 ; Reynolds et al . , 2020 ; Thompson et al . , 2017 ) . Research performed in rats established our foundational understanding of SCN2A , like the temporal patterning of SCN2A expression ( Gong et al . , 1999 ) and the subcellular localization of Nav1 . 2 ( Westenbroek et al . , 1989 ) . In Sprague Dawley rats , Nav1 . 2 protein is expressed within the forebrain , substantia nigra , hippocampus , and the molecular and granular layers of the cerebellum ( Westenbroek et al . , 1989 ) while Nav1 . 2 mRNA was highly expressed within the pyramidal and granule layer of the dentate gyrus as well as the granule layer of the cerebellum ( Black et al . , 1994 ) . Nav1 . 2 was further found to have a complementary expression pattern with Nav1 . 1 throughout the rat cortex and preferentially localized to axons ( Gong et al . , 1999 ) . Further background work utilizing Sprague Dawley rats revealed a population of Nav1 . 2 lacking the beta - 2 subunit during the first two weeks of life that was not present in older animals , indicating that Scn2a undergoes developmental stage - specific changes ( Gong et al . , 1999 ) . Recently , a Long Evans rat Scn2a + / − model was engineered using CRISPR - Cas9 to"}
