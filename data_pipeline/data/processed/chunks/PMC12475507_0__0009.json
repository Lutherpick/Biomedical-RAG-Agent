In the 7 ‐ fold cross ‐ validation process , the stroke dataset was randomly divided into seven subsets . Six of these subsets were used for model training , while the remaining one was used for testing . This process was repeated seven times , ensuring that each sample was included in both the training and testing phases . This approach not only minimizes the bias introduced by the small sample size but also helps prevent overfitting , thereby enhancing the model ' s adaptability and stability in practical applications [ 35 ] . Additionally , to eliminate the potential confounding effects of anesthesia or other extraneous factors that might influence EEG signals , we compared the EEG data from the pMCAO stroke model with that of a sham stroke group . This comparative analysis ensured that the EEG alterations observed in the stroke group were indeed due to the stroke itself , rather than being influenced by non ‐ pathological factors such as anesthesia recovery or surgical procedures . The inclusion of the sham ‐ operated group provided further validation for the specificity of the EEG features observed in the ischemic stroke model , reinforcing the robustness and relevance of our findings in identifying stroke ‐ related EEG biomarkers . In this study , although we integrated optimized algorithms with EEG data to achieve robust results , it is important to acknowledge that the research remains in exploratory stages , there are several limitations . First , one major limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size , consisting of seven pMCAO and four sham ‐ operated mice . While we employed 7 ‐ fold cross ‐ validation to mitigate the effects of overfitting and improve the reliability of the model evaluation , we acknowledge that the statistical power remains limited . A small dataset may reduce the generalizability of the findings and increase the risk of model bias , particularly in detecting subtle signal variations . Future research should include larger and more diverse animal cohorts to further validate the model ' s robustness and stability . Another important limitation is the inherent physiological and pathological differences between mice and humans , which may affect the translational relevance of the findings . Although the pMCAO mouse model provides a well ‐ established and controlled platform for simulating LVO stroke and collecting high ‐ resolution EEG data , it cannot fully replicate the complexity of human stroke pathophysiology . Therefore , caution must be exercised when applying these results to human populations . Future studies should include clinical validation using EEG recordings from stroke patients to assess whether the proposed model performs similarly in real ‐ world clinical environments . Future research could expand in several directions . On the one hand , investigations should include other stroke subtypes , such as ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes , to evaluate the broader applicability of deep learning models . On the other hand , advancements in EEG acquisition technology and deep learning algorithms promise higher ‐ resolution data and more sophisticated signal processing capabilities . These improvements may enable real ‐ time analysis and one ‐ click identification of EEG data , facilitating the use of EEG as a practical tool for pre ‐ hospital acute stroke diagnosis . Such developments could significantly reduce diagnostic delays and improve outcomes for patients by providing efficient and accurate solutions for hyper ‐"}
