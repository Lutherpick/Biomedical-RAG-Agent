These improvements may enable real ‐ time analysis and one ‐ click identification of EEG data , facilitating the use of EEG as a practical tool for pre ‐ hospital acute stroke diagnosis . Such developments could significantly reduce diagnostic delays and improve outcomes for patients by providing efficient and accurate solutions for hyper ‐ acute stroke detection [ 36 ] . In conclusion , this study further confirms the potential of EEG in hyper ‐ acute stroke diagnosis , laying a theoretical foundation for the future development of non ‐ invasive , real ‐ time stroke monitoring tools . Using a pMCAO mouse model , the research successfully identified LVO stroke states during the hyper ‐ acute phase with high accuracy . The deep learning framework demonstrated exceptional sensitivity to subtle EEG variations , enabling precise and reliable classification . Although the study is limited by a small sample size and its focus on LVO strokes , the findings provide valuable insights into the feasibility of EEG ‐ based stroke detection . With advancements in algorithms and real ‐ time EEG technologies , the prospect of one ‐ click stroke diagnosis in prehospital settings holds significant promise for improving stroke care .
