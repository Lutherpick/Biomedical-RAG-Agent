Nav1 . 2 is known to play a significant role in adult animal ’ s excitatory neurons but may also influence inhibitory neurons early in development ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ) . Moreover , there are two isoforms of Nav1 . 2 : the neonatal and adult . The neonatal isoform of Nav1 . 2 is less excitable than the adult isoform and is replaced by the adult isoform starting around P9 in mice ( Gazina et al . , 2010 ; Gazina et al . , 2015 ) . Some SCN2A variants exhibit greater and more severe dysfunction in the neonatal isoform than the adult ( Muller , 2020 ; Thompson et al . , 2020 ; Ben - Shalom et al . , 2017 ) . For example , SCN2A variants associated with SeLFNIE exhibit early - onset seizures that remit within the first few years of life ( Xu et al . , 2007 ) . These findings support the idea that the two isoforms of SCN2A have different roles in neuronal excitability and could differentially contribute to observed phenotypes . Therefore , it is reasonable to suggest that variation in the ages of the Scn2a mutant mice evaluated for behavior may contribute to some of the differential findings . To determine the full developmental and functional impact of Nav1 . 2 variants , regardless of isoform , SCN2A models should be explored from a developmental perspective , and results should be reported with those details . It is key to note that SCN2A is not a sex - linked gene , and therefore disorders secondary to SCN2A mutations have an equal likelihood of occurring in both males and females at similar rates . However , SCN2A variants could interact with sex - dependent genes and hormones differently . For instance , the p . K1422E variant was found to disrupt the estrous cycle of female mice , which could lead to different behavioral phenotypes between male and female mice ( Echevarria - Cooper & Kearney , 2023 ) . Without accounting for hormonal cycles , multiple investigations of Scn2a mice have already noted behavioral differences between male and female mice ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2022 ; Marcantonio et al . , 2023 ; Schattling et al . , 2016 ; Spratt et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) . Thus , it is paramount that SCN2A - related disorders continue to be equally investigated in male and female animals , as sex differences could create differences in the presentation of symptoms . Lastly , the background strain of the animals themselves likely contributes to the contrasting behavioral results between similar Scn2a models . In work with GOF Scn2a models the genetic background strain has been shown to alter the severity of displayed phenotypes ( Bergren et al . , 2005 ; Thompson et al . , 2017 ) . Experiments completed with different genetic strains highlight the importance of considering both genetic and epigenetic modifiers when thinking about how Scn2a variants lead to disease . It has yet to be determined which background strain most accurately and reliably recapitulates human symptomatology of Scn2a - related disorders . SCN2A - related disorders can drastically change a child ’ s quality of life ; therefore , it is imperative to determine the varying"}
