S7G , H ) , suggesting that p53 may be acting through a non - apoptotic downstream pathway . Collectively , these findings indicate that converging mechanisms of p53 activation , including its upregulation and amino - terminal phosphorylation , drive PC death via non - apoptotic mechanisms in SMNΔ7 mice and possibly severe SMA patients . To determine whether intrinsic effects of SMN deficiency in PC contribute to cerebellar pathology and the SMA phenotype , we established AAV9 vectors for selective expression in PCs of either GFP ( AAV9 - L7 - 6 - GFP ) or human SMN ( AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN ) driven by a previously characterized , PC - specific minimal promoter ( L7 - 6 ) 76 . First , we analyzed GFP expression to determine the onset and cell - specific expression of this viral approach . SMA mice injected ICV at P0 with AAV9 - L7 - 6 - GFP exhibited highly selective expression of GFP in ~ 90 % of PCs as early as 24 hours after injection , while no GFP was detectable in the cerebrum , dorsal root ganglions ( DRGs ) , spinal cord , and muscles up to 10 days after injection ( Fig . S8A - E ) . To assess the efficacy and selectivity of SMN restoration by AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN , we utilized immunohistochemistry to visualize SMN - containing nuclear structures known as gemini of coiled bodies ( gems ) 77 as a readout for SMN expression . Gems were observed in ~ 90 % of PCs from SMA mice injected with AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN , whereas less than 1 % of PCs contained gems in SMA mice treated with AAV9 - L7 - 6 - GFP ( Fig . S8F , G ) . In contrast , AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN did not elevate SMN expression in vulnerable lumbar L1 motor neurons of SMA mice . ( Fig . S8H , I ) . Together , these findings highlight selective and efficient restoration of SMN in SMA PCs following transduction with our viral - mediated approach . Next , we investigated the impact of restoring SMN selectively in PCs on cerebellar circuit pathology . Treatment with AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN , but not with AAV9 - L7 - 6 - GFP , led to a significant reduction in the percentage of p53 + PCs and increased PC numbers in SMA mice ( Fig . 7A – C ) , strengthening the link between SMN - dependent p53 activation and cell - autonomous PC death . SMN restoration in SMA PCs also enhanced dendritic arborization and mildly mitigated cerebellar hypoplasia in lobules VI / VII ( Fig . 7D , E ) . Furthermore , AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN improved the number of inhibitory VGAT + synapses likely originating from neighboring rescued PCs ( Fig . 7F , G and Fig . S3A ) . In contrast , the loss of excitatory VGLUT1 + synapses from parallel fibers onto PCs was not reversed by AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN ( Fig . S9A - C ) , highlighting the non - cell - autonomous origin of this defect . These improvements were cerebellum - specific as AAV9 - L7 - 6 - SMN treatment did not ameliorate spinal cord pathology , including p53"}
