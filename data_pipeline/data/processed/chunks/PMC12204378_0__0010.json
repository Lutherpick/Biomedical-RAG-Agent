The identification of selective PC reduction and hypoplasia of vermal lobules VI and VII in end - stage severe SMA mice complements previous reports of PC pathology in the hemispheres of severe SMA mice42 , 43 and in SMA patients45 – 47 , 78 , 79 . Our longitudinal analysis also reveals that SMA PCs are initially formed and then progressively degenerate . Importantly , through viral - mediated selective restoration of SMN in PCs , which leads to improved survival and dendritic arborizations , we highlight the cell - autonomous requirement of SMN for early development , maturation , and survival of PCs . We also addressed the intrinsic , SMN - dependent death mechanisms of vulnerable SMA PCs by showing that they display early onset , progressive nuclear accumulation of amino - terminally phosphorylated p53 ( p - p53S18 ) . As is the case for PC loss , this is a shared signature of degenerating PCs in both Type I SMA patients and severe SMA mice . Furthermore , we demonstrate that AAV9 - mediated knockdown of p53 or overexpression of Stasimon prevent PC degeneration in SMA mice by suppressing upregulation and amino - terminal phosphorylation of p53 , respectively . Together , these findings indicate that the SMN - dependent , RNA - mediated mechanisms driving cell - autonomous death of SMA PCs most likely parallel those at play in SMA motor neurons18 – 20 , 23 , 24 . Furthermore , while p53 is a well - known mediator of apoptosis during PC development and degeneration80 , 81 , we show that overexpression of the anti - apoptotic protein Bcl - xL does not prevent the loss of SMA PCs . Consistent with previous observations in SMA motor neurons18 , these findings support the conclusion that p53 - mediated neurodegeneration occurs through non - apoptotic mechanisms in SMA mice . The identification of such neurodegenerative mechanisms remains an important question to be addressed in future studies . Beyond neuronal death of PCs , we identify cerebellar circuit dysfunction as a novel disease feature characterized by the degeneration of excitatory parallel fiber boutons and the selective loss of inhibitory synapses onto vulnerable SMA PCs in lobules VI and VII . SMN restoration in SMA PCs indicates that these inhibitory inputs originate from neighboring PCs , consistent with established local PC - to - PC inhibitory circuits50 , 51 . In contrast , selective SMN restoration in SMA PCs does not rescue excitatory parallel fiber synapses from GCs , which are not targeted by this gene delivery approach . Together with direct experimental evidence uncoupling spinal cord and cerebellar pathology , we conclude that local disruption of excitatory signaling between parallel fibers and PCs is the main driver of circuit dysfunction in the SMA cerebellum . It is also likely that the observed broadening of the action potentials and reduced firing rate in SMA PCs reflects the selective loss of their afferent excitatory synapses through mechanisms analogous to those previously described for SMA motor neurons21 , 22 , 25 , 34 , 35 . Thus , neuronal firing deficits triggered by dysfunction of local excitatory circuits emerges as a common pathogenic mechanism affecting the functional output of both spinal cord and cerebellum in SMA . To date , a direct role for cerebellar dysfunction to the clinical phenotypes of motor neuron diseases has not been established . Here , we provide initial evidence linking cerebellar pathology"}
