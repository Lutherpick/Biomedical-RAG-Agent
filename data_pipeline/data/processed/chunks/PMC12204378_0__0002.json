None of these models exhibited PC loss or cerebellar alterations at disease end - stage ( Fig . S1B – G ) , indicating that PC degeneration and cerebellar hypoplasia are specific features of severe SMA that are not present in other motor neuron diseases . Together , these results identify selective and progressive death of PCs as a disease feature in a severe mouse model of SMA that is validated in post - mortem tissue from Type I SMA patients . To assess PC function in SMA mice , we recorded intracellularly from vulnerable PCs of lobules VI / VII at early ( P5 ) and late ( P10 ) stages of cerebellar pathology ( Fig . 2A ) . At P5 , we found no significant differences in input resistance ( Rin ) , time constant ( τ ) and capacitance of SMA PCs ( Fig . S2A - D ) , suggesting neither changes in their passive membrane properties nor in their morphology occur at the onset of degeneration . Moreover , while these SMA PCs exhibited no alteration in rheobase , they had lower resting potential ( RMP ) and lower voltage firing threshold ( Vthr ) ( Fig . S2E - G ) . The action potentials ( APs ) of SMA PCs were narrower with a mildly increased amplitude compared to controls ( Fig . S2H - J ) . In agreement , SMA PCs showed significantly higher evoked firing frequencies ( Fig . S2K , L ) and a tendency toward increased spontaneous firing ( Fig . S2M ) , suggesting that an increased output of the cerebellar cortex may take place before substantial loss of PCs . At a later disease stage ( P10 ) , SMA PCs were hyperexcitable as indicated by an increased Rin and decreased rheobase ( Fig . 2B – D ) , while RMP , Vthr and AP amplitude were unaltered ( Fig . S2N - P ) . A significantly decreased capacitance and unchanged τ are indicative of smaller soma size and proximal dendritic trees in vulnerable SMA PCs from lobules VI / VII ( Fig . 2E and Fig . S2Q ) , which agrees with the morphological analysis ( Fig . 2F – H ) . Thus , the observed hyperexcitability likely reflects the decreased size of PCs . In contrast , PCs located in lobule III , which are resistant to death , showed no morphological signs of impairment ( Fig . S2R ) . The evoked as well as the spontaneous AP firing rate of PCs were reduced by ~ 50 % in SMA mice relative to control littermates at P10 ( Fig . 2I – L ) . The paradox of hyperexcitability and reduced functional output could be explained by the increased AP half - width , which was significantly wider in the repolarizing phase of SMA PCs at P10 ( Fig . 2M , N ) . These results indicate a decreased functional output of degenerating PCs at disease end - stage in SMA mice . Together , our findings indicate that the functional output of the cerebellar cortex is increased at an early stage of disease prior to PC loss , but it is significantly reduced at later stages concomitant with PC death in SMA mice . The functional output of PCs is shaped by the activity of excitatory and inhibitory cerebellar neurons . Therefore , we investigated whether cerebellar circuit dysfunction"}
