These mice displayed phenotypes consistent with developmental epileptic encephalopathy and were not viable after P30 due to frequent seizure activity ( M . Li et al . , 2021 ) . Overall , Scn2a GOF mice have similar seizure phenotypes regardless of the specific mutation . This parallels patient data , as seizure severity is poorly predicted from simply identifying the pathogenic SCN2A variant ( Berecki et al . , 2022 ; Bergren et al . , 2005 , 2009 ; Crawford et al . , 2021 ; Lauxmann et al . , 2018 ; M . Li et al . , 2021 ; Schattling et al . , 2016 ) . SCN2A - p . K1422E is a pathogenic de novo variant of SCN2A located in the Nav1 . 2 channel pore . This variant demonstrates both loss and gain of function characteristics in Nav1 . 2 , which has made it difficult to classify ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2022 ) . P . K1422E impairs the ion selectivity filter of the Nav1 . 2 channel , thus allowing other ions besides sodium to enter ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2022 ) . This mutation diminishes sodium conductance , which alters repolarization and neuronal firing ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2022 ) . The mouse model emulating this Scn2a variant has been evaluated from both behavioral and electrophysiological perspectives . Scn2aE / + mice exhibit reduced anxiety - like behaviors compared to wildtype littermates on the elevated plus maze . However , on the open field test , anxiety - like behaviors are more pronounced in Scn2aE / + female mice compared to wildtype . Scn2aE / + mice also display hypersocial behaviors that may parallel what is seen in humans . These mice also do not have impairments in odor discrimination similar to other Scn2a haploinsufficient mice ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2022 ; Léna & Mantegazza , 2019 ; Marcantonio et al . , 2023 ) . However , Scn2a mutant mice with extremely low levels of Scn2a expression or no Scn2a expression in ObGCs are slower to discriminate odors ( Nunes & Kuner , 2018 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . These findings indicate that there is a level of Scn2a that is required for accurate and efficient olfaction . Scn2aE / + cortical neurons revealed slower action potential initiation , likely due to reduced sodium currents ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2022 ) . Similar characteristics have been identified in immature cultured cortical neurons from other Scn2a haploinsufficient models ( Spratt et al . , 2021 ) . In vivo EEG recordings of Scn2aE / + mice displayed infrequent and spontaneous seizures localized to the posterior cortex . When seizures were induced with flurothyl , Scn2aE / + mice had a slower progression from myoclonic jerks to generalized tonic - clonic seizures ( GTCS ) compared to wildtype C57BL / 6J littermates . Furthermore , the p . K1422E mutation was found to disrupt the estrous cycle in female mice but did not significantly alter the distribution of GTCS onset in female mice ( Echevarria - Cooper & Kearney , 2023 ) . Similar to some GOF models , the Scn2aE / + mice demonstrate strain - dependent neurobehavioral and seizure phenotypes ( Echevarria - Cooper et al ."}
