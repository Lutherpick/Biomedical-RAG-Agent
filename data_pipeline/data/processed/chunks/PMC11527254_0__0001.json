This innovation enabled us to visualize and quantify changes in TH + cell and fiber density unbiasedly in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of 6 - OHDA - treated mice and a vehicle - infused control group . We also extensively assessed differences in neuronal damage between male and female C57BL / 6 mice across three different dosages of 6 - OHDA . Finally , we evaluated chemokine and cytokine expression in the SNpc while screening for pathologically relevant kinases and inflammatory markers in the striatum . 3D mapping highlighted the widespread loss of TH + projections in both hemispheres two weeks after a high dose of 6 - OHDA ( 20 μg ) , coupled with compensatory increases in TH expression in projections targeting subcortical regions . Voxel - wise and region - wise analyses indicated that the loss of catecholaminergic neurons is restricted to the SNpc . Our biochemical and 2D histological findings revealed significant disparities between male and female mice , with females exhibiting resistance to the effects of 6 - OHDA . In male mice , the lowest dose of 6 - OHDA ( 5 μg ) led to gradual striatal fiber loss ( with measurements at days 1 , 7 , and 14 ) , whereas the loss of TH + cells in the SNpc was only gradual for the highest dose ( 20 μg ) . Correspondingly , several cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in the SNpc by the highest 6 - OHDA dosage , consistent with SNpc degeneration . We also examined the infusion site for inflammatory marker expression and phosphorylation of pro - apoptotic kinases . Glial reactivity was observed early on , and pro - apoptotic signaling appeared specific to DAPK1 , suggesting the involvement of this protein kinase in the pathophysiology associated with the loss of SNpc neurons . Our comprehensive characterization of the 6 - OHDA mouse model expands our understanding of its pathology and may inform the development and screening of experimental therapeutics for neuroprotective and immunomodulatory treatments for Parkinson ’ s disease . Eight - week - old male and female C57BL / 6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . Unless otherwise specified , animals were group - housed ( four / five per cage ) in environmentally controlled rooms ( 19 . 5 – 21 . 5 ° C , 60 – 65 % relative humidity ) with a 12 - hour reverse light / dark cycle ( lights on at 8 p . m . ) . Mice were held in 100 % PET disposable individually ventilated cages ( IVC ) with a filter cage IVC lid . The cages were docked into IVC Innoracks designed to offer continuous airflow within the cages and dual HEPA - filtered ventilation ( Innovive ) . Cages were filled with ALPHA - dri bedding , and mice had free access to water and food ( chow Teklad global 18 % protein rodent diet ) . The Stanford University Administrative Panel approved all procedures and animal husbandry practices for Laboratory and Animal Care ( APLAC ) and adhered to the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . Our laboratory is also compliant with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care ("}
