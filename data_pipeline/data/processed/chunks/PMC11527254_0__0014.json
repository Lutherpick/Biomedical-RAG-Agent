In this study , we investigated the histopathological effects of 6 - OHDA infusion into the striatum of C57BL / 6 mice . Using a novel image analysis technique to map brain - wide changes in TH expression and relate these to TH + neuron and projection densities , we found that neurodegeneration from 20 μg 6 - OHDA at 14 days post - infusion was confined to the SNpc and associated with widespread , bilateral denervation of its striatal and extra - nigrostriatal targets , along with compensatory TH upregulation in subcortical regions . Male mice showed more severe pathology , indicating potential neuroprotective mechanisms in females . In male mice , lower doses ( 5 and 10 μg ) led to a delayed reduction in striatal TH expression , primarily at day 14 , while the highest dose ( 20 μg ) caused a progressive , severe decrease in dopaminergic fibers in the striatum . Both optical fractionation and mean fluorescence intensity reliably indicated TH + cell loss in the SNpc , validating the latter as an efficient alternative to stereological counting . We observed robust glial activation ( CD68 , Iba1 , LAMP1 , GFAP ) in the striatum three days after 6 - OHDA infusion , along with an upregulation of inflammatory markers in the SNpc that began within a day and primarily sustained for at least a week preceding morphological cell death . Additionally , we found that 20 μg of 6 - OHDA activated DAPK1 in the striatum , potentially promoting excitotoxicity , while GSK - 3β and AKT did not regulate pro - apoptotic signaling . We demonstrated that the 6 - OHDA lesion can be extensively characterized with light - sheet fluorescence microscopy ( LSFM ) and quantitative 3D analysis of TH + neurons . Likewise , Roostalu , et al . observed a similar , albeit milder , pattern of TH loss after systemic injection of MPTP . 35 Our catecholaminergic mapping data aligns with the conventional WB and 2D quantification techniques used in this and other studies . 36 , 37 For example , 6 - OHDA decreased the density of TH + cells 51 – 52 % in a singular cluster localized 89 – 95 % to the SNpc , 4 – 9 % to the VTA , and 1 – 2 % to the supramammillary nucleus ( SUM ) . Conversely , loss of TH + fibers was widespread , impacting the striatum , isocortex , midbrain , hippocampal formation , olfactory areas , and amygdalar nuclei . As TH + fiber loss spreads beyond regions with dopaminergic innervation — such as the striatum , amygdala , hippocampus , prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate area38 , and rhinal cortices39 — damage also affects noradrenergic projections . These projections extend widely across the brain , reaching areas including the isocortex , thalamus , hypothalamus , hippocampus , amygdala , and cerebellum . In contrast to the widespread TH + fiber loss , compensatory increases were spatially confined to a few subcortical regions , including the thalamus , hypothalamus , midbrain , pallidum , and lateral septal nucleus . Consistent with this , bilateral remodeling of efferents and afferents connected to the dopaminergic A13 cell group in the hypothalamus has been reported following a unilateral infusion of 6 - OHDA ( 3 . 6 μg ) into the medial forebrain bundle , with mapping occurring 29 days later . 40 Although the paraventricular hypothalamus ( PVH ) , dopaminergic A13 group , the nucleus"}
