While we found no pp53S15 immunoreactivity in control tissue , nuclear p - p53S15 accumulation was detected in small degenerating PCs of the SMA cerebellum ( Fig . 6F and Fig . S7E ) . Consistent with our findings in SMNΔ7 mice , these results point to the induction of p - p53S15 as a conserved event and a candidate marker of PC degeneration in SMA patients . To determine whether p53 activation drives the death of SMA PCs , newborn SMNΔ7 mice were injected intracerebroventricularly ( ICV ) with a self - complementary adeno - associated virus serotype 9 ( AAV9 ) expressing GFP and a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) against mouse p53 , which was previously validated to knockdown p53 in vivo18 , or GFP alone as a control . AAV9 - p53shRNA exclusively transduced PCs in the cerebellum with ~ 70 % efficacy measured by GFP expression ( Fig . S7F , H ) . Importantly , injection of AAV9 - p53shRNA but not AAV9 - GFP strongly reduced nuclear p53 staining ( Fig . 6G , H ) and increased the number of PCs in lobules VI / VII of SMNΔ7 mice ( Fig . 6G , I ) , demonstrating that p53 activation drives selective PC death in SMA mice . Previous work showed that SMN - dependent splicing dysregulation of Stasimon – an essential ER resident transmembrane protein71 , 72 – contributes to p53S18 phosphorylation and motor neuron death in SMA models19 , 32 . To determine whether Stasimon dysfunction is linked to the death of SMA PCs , we ICV injected SMNΔ7 mice at P0 with a previously described AAV9 vector driving Stasimon expression ( AAV9 - STAS ) 19 . Notably , Stasimon gene delivery reduced the percentage of PCs expressing p - p53S18 ( Fig . 6E ) , did not alter the nuclear accumulation of p53 ( Fig . 6G , H ) , and significantly increased the number of PCs compared to AAV9 - GFP treatment in SMA mice at P10 ( Fig . 6G , I ) . In contrast , gene delivery of either AAV9 - p53shRNA , or AAV9 - STAS did neither improve PC shape nor lobule size in SMNΔ7 mice ( Fig . 6J , K ) . These results highlight the contribution of Stasimon dysfunction to the amino - terminal phosphorylation of p53 and selective death of PCs in SMA mice . A well - established pathway by which p53 activation executes cell death is through apoptosis73 . Additionally , multiple studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of Bcl - xL protects neurons from p53 - induced apoptosis by preventing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and caspase activation74 . To determine whether p53 drives PC death in SMA mice through apoptosis , we injected SMNΔ7 mice with a previously validated AAV9 vector expressing Bcl - xL fused to mCherry ( AAV9 - Bcl - xL ) 75 . Interestingly , robust expression of mCherry - Bcl - xL in ~ 90 % of SMA PCs did neither alter p53 expression nor rescue these neurons from degeneration ( Fig . 6G – I and Fig . S7G , H ) , suggesting that p53 may be acting through a non - apoptotic downstream pathway . Collectively , these findings indicate that converging mechanisms of p53 activation , including its upregulation and amino - terminal phosphorylation , drive"}
