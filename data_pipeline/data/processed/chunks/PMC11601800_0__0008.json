Behaviorally , Scn2afl / + / Emx1 - Cre had significantly more rearing events in the open field assay than wildtype C57BL / 6J littermates ( Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ) . Scn2afl / + / Emx1 - Cre mice further displayed signs of possible hyperactivity and decreased anxiety - like phenotypes in the open field test . Scn2afl / + / Vgat - Cre mice did not display these phenotypes in the open field test , but in the elevated plus maze , Scn2afl / + / Vgat - Cre mice demonstrated reduced anxiety - like phenotypes ( Figure 4 , Supplemental table 2 ) ( Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ) . These results suggest that Nav1 . 2 loss in dorsal - telencephalic excitatory neurons contributes to hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors , while anxiety - like phenotypes change in distinct ways when Nav1 . 2 is lost in dorsal - telencephalic excitatory neurons or inhibitory neurons . Nav1 . 2 expression in inhibitory neurons may be related to risk behavior , and loss of Nav1 . 2 in these cells is what is driving the mice to explore more in the elevated plus maze . In contrast , Nav1 . 2 in dorsal - telencephalic excitatory neurons may be more related to general exploration and locomotion , which is why there are different performances on the open field and elevated plus maze between the two conditional models . ECoG data from Scn2afl / + / Emx1 - Cre mice indicates that these animals have absence - like seizure activity and these animals further displayed spike - wave discharges ( SWDs ) during moments of behavioral quiescence which is typical of seizure activity ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ; Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) ( Figure 4 , Supplemental Table 2 ) . However , Scn2afl / + / Vgat - Cre mice did not display seizure activity or behavioral quiescence ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ; Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . These data indicate that partial loss of Nav1 . 2 in inhibitory neurons is unlikely to be driving seizures in these animals , but partial loss of Nav1 . 2 in forebrain excitatory neurons is sufficient to cause seizures . Two other Cre - driver Scn2a models were engineered using the same Scn2a floxed mouse to elucidate if the SWDs had specific cortical striatal involvement ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ) . The new lines , Scn2afl / fl / Trpc - Cre mice and Scn2afl / fl / Ntsr - Cre mice , deleted Scn2a from cortical layer 5 ( L5 ) and cortical layer 6 pyramidal neurons ( L6 ) respectively ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ) . Scn2afl / fl / Trpc - Cre mice , but not Scn2afl / fl / Ntsr - Cre mice , displayed SWDs that matched the previously identified seizure phenotype , which indicates that L5 neurons and not L6 are likely involved in the identified absence seizure phenotype ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ) . Further research will be needed to illuminate how each subclass of L5 neurons , intratelencephalic or extratelencephalic , is involved . Bilateral injections of adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) expressing Cre recombinase were injected into Scn2afl / fl mice to selectively delete Scn2a from mPFC or VTA to elucidate the role of Nav1 . 2 in schizophrenia"}
