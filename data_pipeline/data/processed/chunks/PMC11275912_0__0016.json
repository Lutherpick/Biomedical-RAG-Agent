To elucidate the reason for such an observation , we investigated whether C22 affected proinsulin protein folding by measuring the abundance of aberrant disulfide - linked proinsulin complexes . Two of the most readily quantifiable misfolded forms of proinsulin are its disulfide - linked dimer and trimer forms , and the ratio of these aberrant forms to monomeric proinsulin was markedly improved by C22 treatment ( Figure 6D – E ) . We hypothesized that C22 mediated reduction in BiP AMPylation may contribute to improved proinsulin folding by increasing the pool of active BiP . Indeed , we observed an approximately 2 . 5 - fold decrease in AMPylated BiP levels in cells treated with C22 as compared to cells treated with DMSO ( Figure 6F – G ) while cells treated with C73 showed no changes in AMPylated BiP levels ( Supplementary Figure S10E – F ) . These results indicate that FICD inhibitor C22 promotes proinsulin folding and anterograde trafficking out of the ER by increasing the pool of chaperone - competent BiP , which reduces misfolded or aggregated proinsulin levels . In this study , we define a pair of small molecules , C22 and C73 , as novel FICD inhibitors with limited cytotoxicity . We show that these molecules inhibit BiP AMPylation by both wild - type and pathogenic FICD variants and highlight their potential to improve pro - insulin folding and secretion in pancreatic β - cells . We further demonstrate that the compounds are amendable to rational medicinal chemistry - based improvements and present a proposed mode of target engagement supported by in - silico and cell - based work . Recent advances in our understanding of FICD biology provide a compelling premise for the development of FICD inhibitors for therapeutic considerations . FICD - mediated cycles of BiP AMPylation and deAMPylation regulate ER homeostasis . Pathogenic mutations in the FICD active site disrupt this equilibrium , leading to loss of deAMPylation function , which results in the accumulation of AMPylated BiP21 , 22 . Additional work indicates that loss of endogenous FICD activity mitigates pressure overload - induced cardiac hypertrophy by inducing a robust UPRER response and enhancing ER - phagy in cardiomyocytes25 . In this study , we show direct evidence for enhanced proinsulin processing in response to FICD inhibition . In all these scenarios , FICD inhibitors are expected to provide immediate benefit by reducing BiP AMPylation to restore and / or boost UPRER signaling and ER homeostasis . A small number of putative in vitro FICD inhibitors have previously been described54 – 56 . Unlike compounds C22 , and its sodium salt , C73 , however , these molecules were not tested against endogenous or pathogenic FICD variants . C22 and C73 are thus the first tool compounds to efficiently inhibit FICD in tissue culture models . C22 , a halogenated salicylanilide , further shows functional group flexibility in the biaryl region of the scaffold which amends itself for rational improvement . Using a combination of in - silico MD simulations and cell - based assays , we provide evidence that FICD inhibitors C22 and 73 stably bind dimeric FICD , preferentially at the smaller dimeric interface or the TPR - II domain . We propose that this interaction prevents BiP AMPylation by either blocking the switch to an AMPylation - competent ,"}
