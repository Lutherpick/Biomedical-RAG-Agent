Using these criteria , we identified 4 , 019 compounds in our primary screen ( 4 . 7 % hit rate ) . To validate our primary hits , we followed a classic small molecule testing paradigm ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) . First , we re - tested all 4 , 019 primary hits in a secondary screen , which was performed in triplicate . These experiments confirmed 646 of the initial 4 , 019 compounds to reduce FICDE234G auto - AMPylation . Of the 646 compounds , we selected 126 compounds that reduced FICDE234G activity in both screens by at least 20 % , showed good accessibility for site - chain modifications , and were not reported to exhibit pan - assay interference ( PAINs ) . Of these 126 compounds , 55 belonged to the repurposing library and were tested in concentration - response experiments , in which 45 showed dose - dependent FICD inhibition ( Supplementary File 1 ) . The subsequent exclusion of known modulators of human enzymes further shrunk our hit list to 6 molecules . Next , we used MScreen38 , a compound management and HTS data analysis tool , to search for analogs exhibiting at least 40 % structural similarity to the selected 6 hits . We identified 133 additional analogs , which were subsequently tested in triplicate . After these experiments , we were left with 19 compounds that reduced FICDE234G auto - AMPylation by at least 20 % . Concentration - response experiments confirmed 13 of these 19 compounds as dose - dependent FICDE234G inhibitors . We then repeated these tests using fresh commercially sourced chemical matter , which confirmed 7 compounds ( Supplementary Figure S3B ) exhibiting IC50 < 20 μM ( Supplementary Figure S3C , Supplementary Table 2 ) . These 7 molecules were selected for validation in orthogonal assays . Our initial in - vitro assays tested for inhibition of auto - AMPlyation of FICDE234G , a mutant enzyme version with constitutive AMPylation activity . In the next step , we determined if the seven putative FICD inhibitors reduced the activity of endogenous FICD in intact cells . In these assays , we analyzed AMPylation of BiP , perhaps the best characterized FICD target8 , 9 , 18 , 19 , 22 , 39 – 42 . We incubated A549 cells with the compounds for approximately 12 hours in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( GM ) . Afterwards , we replaced GM with sterile PBS containing the compounds and incubated the cells for another hour . In the absence of FICD inhibitors , the PBS treatment acutely depleted cells of nutrients , which led to a progressive increase in BiP AMPylation that reached saturation after approximately 45 mins ( Figure 1D and 1G ) . In contrast , we observed that compounds C22 ( Figure 1E ) and C73 ( Figure 1F ) promoted a concentration - dependent inhibition of FICD - mediated BiP AMPylation in response to nutrition shortage . Compounds C47 , C55 , C83 , C84 , and C522 did not affect BiP AMPylation levels ( Supplementary Figure S4G ) . At the highest tested compound concentration ( 10 μM ) , we observed up to 80 % decrease in BiP AMPylation levels for both C22 ( Figure 1H ) and C73 ( Figure 1I ) . These results confirm C22 and C73 as potent cell permeable FICD inhibitors . Our cell - based assays showed that"}
