Buprenorphine SR ™ LAB was administered every 48 hours to manage pain . Attrition rates ranged between 5 and 30 % depending on the sex and dose of 6 - OHDA infused . Pre - and post - surgical care was conducted per the guidelines outlined by Masini et al . 11 6 - OHDA hydrochloride was from Sigma Aldrich ( Cat : H4381 Lot number : MKCG8789 ) . 6 - OHDA handling and infusions were carried out following the guidelines and safety procedures described by Stott and Barker . 18 Using CED , 6 - OHDA was infused at one of three dosages : 5 μg ( low dose ) 22 , 10 μg ( medium dose ) 18 , or 20 μg ( high dose ) . 17 Vehicle control mice were infused with USP saline 0 . 9 % containing 0 . 03 % ascorbic acid . Mice were unilaterally infused at a rate of 0 . 5 μL / min into the dorsal striatum ( AP = + 0 . 5 mm , ML = + 2 . 1 mm , DV = − 3 . 20 mm from bregma ( see Fig . 1A ) ) . The equipment used for CED consisted of a 10 μL airtight syringe ( Hamilton ) , a 33 - gauge Hamilton needle , and a microinjection pump ( UMP3 , WPI ) connected to an intelligent touch controller ( WPI ) . After the infusion , the needle was left in place for 5 minutes before being slowly withdrawn . The incision site was closed with tissue adhesive ( 3M Vetbond Tissue Adhesive , Cat : 1469SB ) . Before every infusion , the needle and syringe were inspected to ensure accurate delivery of a total volume of 2 μL . For lesion quantification , animals were sacrificed at selected time points : day 1 , day 3 , day 7 , and day 14 ( see Fig . 1 ) . Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane 4 % and intracardially perfused with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Brain regions designated for western blotting ( WB ) and multiplex - cytokine / chemokines , including the striatum and substantia nigra , were quickly sub - dissected and snap - frozen . Hindbrains destined for histological assessment of TH + cells in the SNpc were post - fixed for 48 hours in a 4 % paraformaldehyde and then cryopreserved in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( PB ) containing 30 % sucrose . Tissue processing , sample preparation , and loading into the gels were conducted as described . 23 The antibodies used are listed in Table S1 . The blots were imaged using the Sapphire Molecular Imager and analyzed using Azure Spot ( Azure Biosystems ) software . Coronal brain sections , 30 μm thick , were stained as free - floating slices . Briefly , sections were washed in 0 . 1 M PB containing 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 . The sections were then blocked to prevent nonspecific binding using a mixture of 4 % normal goat serum ( NGS ) and 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in 0 . 1 M PB with 0 . 4 % Triton X - 100 . Slices were incubated with chicken polyclonal anti - TH ( 1 : 2000 , Abcam , ab76442 ) , washed , and then incubated with donkey anti - chicken polyclonal antibody"}
