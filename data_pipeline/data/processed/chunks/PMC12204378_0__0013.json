Mice were housed in a 12h / 12h light / dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum . The following mouse lines were used : SMNΔ7 FVB ( JAX stock # 005025 ) 48 , Smn2B / - C57BL / 6 ( Dr . Kothary ) 103 , SOD1 - WT B6SJL ( JAX stock # 002297 ) , SOD1 - G93A B6SJL ( JAX stock # 002726 ) 104 and Ighmbp2NMD - 2J C57BL / 6 ( JAX stock # 002521 ) 105 . PVCre C57Bl / 6 ( JAX stock # 008069 ) and ChATCre C57Bl / 6 ( JAX stock # 006410 ) lines were crossed with SMNΔ7 mice to generate PvCre tg / - ; Smn + / − ; SMN2tg / tg ; SMNΔ7tg / tg and ChatCre tg / − ; Smn + / − ; SMN2tg / tg ; SMNΔ7tg / tg mice . These strains were bred with mice expressing a Cre - inducible Smn allele ( SMARes ; JAX stock # 007951 ) to generate SMARes + SMNChAT - Cre , SMARes + SMNPV - Cre or SMARes as previously described21 . The following primers were used for genotyping : SMNΔ7 : forward sequence ( 5 ’ to 3 ’ ) = GATGATTCTGACATTTGGGATG , reverse sequences ( 5 ’ to 3 ’ ) = TGGCTTATCTGGAGTTTCACAA and GAGTAACAACCCGTCGGATTC ( wild - type band = 325 base pairs ( bp ) , mSmn KO = 411 bp ) . Smn2B / - : forward sequence ( 5 ’ to 3 ’ ) = TTTGGCAGACTTTAGCAGGGC , reverse sequence ( 5 ’ to 3 ’ ) = AACTCCGGGTCCTCCTTCCT ( wild - type band = 500 bp , mutant = 700 bp ) . SOD1 - WT and SOD1 - G93A : forward sequence ( 5 ’ to 3 ’ ) = CATCAGCCCTAATCCATCTGA , reverse sequence ( 5 ’ to 3 ’ ) = CGCGACTAACAATCAAAGTGA ( transgene = 236bp ) , Ighmbp2NMD - 2J : forward sequence ( 5 ’ to 3 ’ ) = CTGGACAGAGAGAATACCTACAGACTGCTG , reverse sequence ( 5 ’ to 3 ’ ) = GTACTGCTCTGGCAGAAGACCCATGATTGC ( wild - type = 500 bp , mutant = 300 bp ) . For genotyping of the SMARes + SMNChAT - Cre , SMARes + SMNPV - Cre mice , please see21 . For AAV9 gene delivery , P0 mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and injected in the right lateral ventricle of the brain with ~ 1 × 1011 genome copies of AAV9 vectors in a PBS solution containing a vital dye ( Fast Green ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . For phenotypic analysis , SMNΔ7 mice treated with viral interventions were monitored daily for righting time , body weight , and posture time as previously reported34 . Each measurement was taken three times and averaged . To comply with animal welfare guidelines , mice that experienced a 25 % weight loss in a single day and were unable to right themselves were euthanized . Righting time was defined as the time required for a pup to roll onto all four limbs after being placed on its back , maintaining this position for at least 3 seconds . Posture time measured how long a pup could sustain its balance while standing on all four limbs . The tests had a maximum duration"}
