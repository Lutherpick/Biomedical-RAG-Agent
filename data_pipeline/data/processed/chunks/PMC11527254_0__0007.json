Significant voxels in f - statistic p - value maps ( α = 0 . 05 ) were evaluated further with voxel - wise post hoc t - tests . The resulting p - value maps were false discovery rate ( FDR ) corrected using the most stringent q value yielding clusters of significant voxels . Clusters were warped to full - resolution tissue space for TH + cell or fiber density measurements . Clusters were considered valid if there was a difference in the density of TH + cells or fibers ( two - tailed unpaired t - tests ) . Segmentation of TH + cells and fibers was performed with Ilastik . Table S2 summarizes voxel - wise post hoc contrasts , effect directions , FDR q values , the adjusted p - value threshold , and cluster validation rates . Brain - wide quantification of fluorescent labels involves registration of the 3D autofluorescence image with an averaged template brain . We used a template from iDISCO + / LSFM aligned with the common coordinate framework version 3 ( CCFv3 ) of the Allen brain atlas ( ABA ; atlas . brain - map . org / ) . 26 We resampled this atlas and template to 25 - micron resolution and lowered high - intensity IDs . Stitched image volumes were 3D cropped to minimize file sizes . Voxels outside the brain in the autofluorescence channel were zeroed out by setting the min and max of the display range and linearly scaling intensities within this range using Fiji . 27 In the process , images were converted from . czi to a TIFF series . The autofluorescence image was downsampled by a factor of two , reoriented , and saved as a NIfTI image . If needed , additional voxels were masked with 3D Slicer ( 4 . 11 with the SegmentEditorExtraEffects extension ) . A modified version of MIRACL ’ s registration script28 was used to align the autofluorescence image with the average template and the corresponding atlas . We adjusted it to utilize the iDISCO + / LSFM - based template and atlas26 , while also preventing image artifacts caused by bit depth changes and avoiding inaccurate brain masking . Registration accuracy was visually assessed by overlaying a 10 μm resolution version of the autofluorescence image with an aligned atlas image in ITK - SNAP ( 3 . 6 . 0 ) . For three samples , better localization of the locus coeruleus during registration was manually fine - tuned using 3D Slicer . TH - IF image volumes were rolling ball background subtracted using a pixel radius of 20 , increasing the sensitivity of voxel - wise analyses by only preserving signal from labeled cells and fiber tracts . 21 Transformations from registration were applied to warp TH - IF images from tissue space to atlas space . 28 After confirming correct warping using FSLeyes ( part of the FMRIB Software Library [ FSL ] ) , TH - IF images were spatially smoothed to improve the overlap of voxel - wise signals across samples by convolving them with a Gaussian kernel ( using fslmaths - s 0 . 05 ) . 29 The left hemispheres were flipped for comparisons with the right hemispheres . Voxels external to atlas labels or inside ventricles , the olfactory bulb , or undefined regions were excluded from voxel -"}
