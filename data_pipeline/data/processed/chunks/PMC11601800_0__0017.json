Furthermore , the treatment was not shown to induce seizures or lead to phenotypic abnormalities in the animals ( Tamura et al . , 2022 ) . CRISPRa rescue and upregulation of Scn2a was then utilized to recover an appropriate vestibular ocular reflex ( VOR ) in Scn2a + / − mice which is known to be impaired in both humans with pathogenic variants of SCN2A and Scn2a + / − mice ( C . Wang et al . , 2024 ) . Based on the promising results from the mouse models , it appears that using CRISPRa therapy could be a viable and safe avenue for treating SCN2A loss - of - function variants . Further data indicating the safety and efficacy of the CRISPRa treatment will be needed to truly know if this is an avenue of treatment that will benefit individuals like it appears to benefit the Scn2a + / − mice . Another genetic therapy approach involves gapmer antisense oligonucleotides ( ASO ) , which target Scn2a mRNA ( M . Li et al . , 2021 ) . The ASO was developed to alleviate seizures experienced by Scn2aQ / + mice ( M . Li et al . , 2021 ) . Two doses of the ASO ED were tested : ASO ED50 and ED80 , which reduced Scn2a mRNA by 50 % and 80 % , respectively . ASO ED80 was found to be toxic in wildtype C57BL / 6N mice , although it did extend the lifespan of Scn2aQ / + mice and attenuated seizure severity when utilized at P1 ( M . Li et al . , 2021 ) . On the other hand , ASO ED50 , when used at P1 , did not impair weight , sociability , or motor behavior in wildtype C57BL / 6N mice or Scn2aQ / + mice ( M . Li et al . , 2021 ) . However , ASO ED50 did reduce anxiety - like behaviors in Scn2aQ / + mice below what was seen in treated wildtype C57BL / 6N mice ( M . Li et al . , 2021 ) . Treating Scn2aQ / + mice older than P1 with ASO ED50 still attenuated seizure severity and extended lifespan compared to untreated animals , which suggests some degree of flexibility in the treatment window ( M . Li et al . , 2021 ) . From the reported data , it seems plausible that ASO therapy may benefit some SCN2A variants . However , ASO therapies need to be tailored to specific variants to be effective , and the heterogeneous nature of SCN2A reduces the possibility of generating a large - scale treatment of SCN2A - related disorders utilizing this approach ( Lauffer et al . , 2024 ) . Furthermore , Tofersen , the only FDA - approved ASO , is associated with many adverse side effects and has demonstrated limited therapeutic benefit ( Lauffer et al . , 2024 ) . Treatments utilized in SCN2A - related disorders must be safe and effective as it is likely to be provided to children , and aversive side effects may irreversibly alter development . Several pharmacotherapies have been tried in Scn2a mouse models to attenuate symptoms associated with pathogenic variants . One such drug is CX516 , a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors ( Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 ) . Intraperitoneal injection of CX516 at least 10 minutes prior to behavioral"}
