Similar to some GOF models , the Scn2aE / + mice demonstrate strain - dependent neurobehavioral and seizure phenotypes ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2023 ) . The mouse line was originally generated on the C57BL / 6J ( B6 . Scn2aE / + ) background but was later crossed with DBA / 2J ( D2 ) mice to create a mixed background of [ D2xB6 ] , resulting in F1D2 . Scn2aE / + animals ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2022 , 2023 ) . These studies revealed that anxiety - like behaviors are more pronounced in the B6 . Scn2aE / + mice ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2023 ) . F1D2 . Scn2aE / + mice had a seizure profile similar to that of the original B6 . Scn2aE / + , however , a small subset displayed erratic behavior and then behavioral arrest ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2023 ) . Both B6 . Scn2aE / + and F1D2 . Scn2aE / + resisted seizure generalization with kainic acid , but the resistance was more pronounced in the F1D2 . Scn2aE / + mice ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2023 ) . Furthermore , zero of the F1D2 . Scn2aE / + mice reached stage 6 of the Racine scale ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2022 , 2023 ) . Results from the Scn2aE / + mice highlight how Scn2a variants can present with characteristics of both gain and loss of function , and SCN2A - related disorders are likely much more complicated than the variants ’ channel kinetics . The voltage - gated potassium channel , Kv7 . 2 , has been shown to contribute to seizure phenotypes seen in Scn2aQ54 mice ( Kearney et al . , 2006 ) . This potassium channel generates M currents that modulate hippocampal neurons ’ firing pattern and excitability ( Kearney et al . , 2006 ) . When Scn2aQ54 mice also have a mutation in Kv7 . 2 , which reduces the function and activity of the potassium channel , seizure severity of the Scn2aQ54 mice is exacerbated and premature death occurs around P21 ( Kearney et al . , 2006 ) . The intense seizure phenotype of the double mutant mice suggests that M currents play an important and likely necessary role in modulating seizure initiation and spreading ( Aiba & Noebels , 2021 ) . Knowing that M currents can regulate seizure severity in an Scn2a mouse model opens the possibility of developing a treatment targeting Kv7 . 2 to alleviate SCN2A - related seizures . Potassium channels also modulate Scn2a + / − phenotypes ( Indumathy et al . , 2021 ; Mishra et al . , 2017 ) . Mice heterozygous for both Scn2a and Kcn1 , a gene encoding for the pore - forming subunit of the voltage - gated potassium channel KV1 . 1 ( Scn2a + / − ; Kcna1 + / − ) , have reduced anxiety and autism - like behaviors compared to Scn2a + / − mice ( Indumathy et al . , 2021 ) . In addition , the downregulation of potassium channels was found to contribute to the hyperexcitability of medium spiny neurons cultured from Scn2agtKO / gtKO mice ( Zhang et al"}
