Development and evaluation of deep learning model based on 5 h hyperacute phase EEG . ( A ) Displays the confusion matrix constructed by the model , where 1 represents the positive class and 0 represents the negative class . ( B ) Loss curve , the horizontal axis is the number of iterations per epoch , and the vertical axis is the loss value . It can be seen that as the number of iterations per epoch increases , the loss value gradually decreases and becomes stable , indicating that the model is already in a convergence state . ( C ) ROC curve , the AUC is 0 . 98 . ( D ) t ‐ SNE visualization of EEGNet features . To deepen our understanding of the dynamic changes in EEG signals following stroke , provide more accurate diagnostic insights , and enrich time ‐ series data for training deep learning models to enhance predictive performance , we segmented the hyper ‐ acute phase stroke model in mice into five distinct hourly intervals for analysis . The detailed evaluation parameters include ACC , AUC , precision , recall , F1 score , and Std for each time interval . As shown in Table 1 , the model achieved high and stable accuracy throughout the 6 ‐ h hyper ‐ acute phase , with values of 99 . 2 % ( within 1 . 5 h ) , 95 . 1 % ( 2 h ) , 98 . 0 % ( 3 h ) , 99 . 8 % ( 4 h ) , 97 . 1 % ( 5 h ) , and 97 . 0 % ( 6 h ) . Similarly , AUC , precision , recall , and F1 scores remained above 0 . 95 across nearly all intervals , with only minor fluctuations observed ( e . g . , a modest dip in F1 score at 3 h to 0 . 936 ) . These variations are likely due to physiological variability or sample ‐ level randomness and do not indicate a systematic degradation in performance . Given the uniformly strong classification results , the differences between time intervals are relatively small and may hold limited statistical or practical significance . This further supports the model ' s consistent performance and diagnostic utility throughout the early post ‐ stroke period . Evaluation metrics of deep learning models across different classifications . Abbreviations : Acc , accuracy ; AUC , the area under the curve ; std . , standard deviation . Given that the model demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing stroke and healthy states across various time periods , particularly during the 1 – 22 h , we further investigated the earliest time point at which the model could reliably detect stroke . To this end , we analyzed EEG data collected within the first 1 . 5 h following stroke onset . As shown in Table 1 and Figure 4A , which present the classification metrics and t ‐ SNE visualization respectively , the model maintained exceptionally high classification accuracy during the early period , with an accuracy of 99 . 2 % ( 0 . 992 ± 0 . 013 ) and an AUC of 0 . 982 ± 0 . 023 . These findings suggest that the model retains strong diagnostic capability even in the hyper ‐ acute phase , within the first 1 . 5 h after stroke onset . t ‐ SNE results across different time segments ,"}
