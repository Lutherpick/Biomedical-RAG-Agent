In the next step , we used the same protocol to identify and rank putative binding sites of C22 and C73 on the strictly monomeric FICD variant16 , FICDL258D ( Figure 2C ) . We found that C22 bound monomeric FICD with a heightened affinity to the top binding site as indicated by a higher MM / PBSA score ( − 43 . 33 + / − 6 . 52 kcal / mol ) as compared to the top 2 binding sites on the dimeric FICD . At this site , the oxygen atoms of C22 formed H - bonds with ASN274 and LYS271 ( Figure 2C ) . These H - bonds , in conjunction with the lack of cation - π interactions as observed in the dimeric form , explained the stronger binding affinity for the monomeric FICD . In contrast , C73 displayed a reduced binding affinity to monomeric FICD at the top binding site compared to the top 2 sites on the dimer ( – 124 . 28 + / − 9 . 23 kcal / mol ) and engages in a single H - bond with ASN274 ( Figure 2C ) . These results indicate that FICD inhibitors , C22 and C73 , may stably bind to both monomeric and dimeric FICD , and inhibit WT FICD - mediated BiP AMPylation by either preventing the switch to the AMPylation competent monomeric state or abrogating BiP binding to FICD . To validate and confirm our in - silico results , we preincubated A549 cells with 10 μM C22 and C73 for approximately 12 hours , allowing them to bind and stabilize deAMPylation - competent WT FICD . We utilized both regular DMEM and commercially available serum - free cell growth media ( Opti - MEM ) to exclude that the fetal calf serum we used in GM reduced bioavailability of the inhibitors52 . Afterwards , we exposed these cells to PBS containing DMSO or compounds at 10 μM concentration . We found that preincubating cells with the FICD inhibitors in Opti - MEM , prior to nutrient depletion , was sufficient to prevent BiP AMPylation . In contrast , cells preincubated with C22 or C73 in GM show no reduction in AMPylated BiP . Cells continuously exposed to C22 or C73 in both media showed significant reductions in AMPylated BiP levels ( Figure 3A – B ) . These results are consistent with our in - silico results and confirm that both C22 and C73 are capable of stabilizing the deAMPylation competent FICD conformation , thereby preventing its switch to an AMPylation competent state . To determine if C22 and C73 further inhibited the AMPylase - competent FICD confirmation , we devised an experiment in which we delayed the addition of FICD inhibitors until after the induction of nutrient depletion stress . This delay provided the cells with enough time to at least initiate the conformational switch required to transition from FICD - mediated deAMPylation to AMPylation . The addition of either C22 or C73 at onset of PBS - induced nutrient shortage significantly reduces BiP AMPylation . Delaying inhibitor addition by 15 mins attenuated the decline in BiP AMPylation , while a 30 min delay in C22 or C73 addition had no effect on BiP AMPylation levels ( Figure 3C – D ) .
