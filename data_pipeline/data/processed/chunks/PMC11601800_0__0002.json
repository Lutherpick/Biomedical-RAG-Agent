Overall , constitutive Scn2a haploinsufficiency appears to impair excitatory cortical neurons in a developmental stage - specific manner and increases seizure susceptibility , although the precise mechanism linking these changes remains unknown . Additional constitutive haploinsufficient Scn2a mouse models exist . While not as well characterized as the Planells - Cases model , they provide further insight into the behavioral and physiologic effects of various genetic disruptions inducing Nav1 . 2 haploinsufficiency . In one such model , the adult Nav1 . 2 channel isoform was expressed in neonatal animals using homologous recombination ( Gazina et al . , 2015 ) . A targeting construct leading to the desired mutation was injected into blastocysts of C57BL / 6 mice to obtain chimeric mice , which were then bred with wildtype C57BL / 6 mice ( Gazina et al . , 2015 ) . The resulting offspring were then crossed with a cre - transgenic mouse strain B6 . C - Tg ( CMV - Cre ) 1Cgn / J to remove the neomycin cassette and thus generate a stable and constitutive line of heterozygous Nav1 . 2adult / + mutants , simply referred to as Nav1 . 2adult mice ( Gazina et al . , 2015 ) . The neonatal and adult isoforms of Scn2a are only one nucleotide different from one another in exon 5 ; the neonatal isoform ( 5N ) expresses an asparagine at residue 209 , while the adult isoform ( 5A ) expresses aspartic acid at the same position ( Gazina et al . , 2010 , 2015 ; Kruth et al . , 2020 ) . 5N is less excitable than 5A , and when 5A was expressed in neonatal mice , they demonstrated signs of hyperactivity and seizure activity ( Figure 2 , Supplemental Table 2 ) ( Gazina et al . , 2015 ) . Data from the human channel also supports the idea of different electrophysical profiles between the two Nav1 . 2 isoforms . Some gain of function human variants cause the Nav1 . 2 5N isoform to mimic the electrophysical properties of 5A , leading to seizures ( Muller , 2020 ; Thompson et al . , 2020 ) . The change in electrophysical properties of Nav1 . 2 during the neonatal period may explain why these individuals had seizure profiles in infancy that attenuated with age ( Muller , 2020 ; Thompson et al . , 2020 ) . Since the neonatal isoform of Scn2a has different electrophysical properties than the adult isoform and can lead to different phenotypic effects when altered , Nav1 . 2 5N and 5A need to be further investigated to elucidate the functional roles of both in SCN2A - related disorders . Another constitutive model deleted exons 4 – 6 to induce Nav1 . 2 haploinsufficiency ( Scn2afl / + ) ( Shin et al . , 2019 ) . Although a large part of the coding sequence for Scn2a was removed , including exon 5 that encodes for the 5N and 5A isoforms , about 60 % expression of Scn2a was maintained in Scn2afl / + mice ( Shin et al . , 2019 ) . Scn2afl / + mice did not display spontaneous seizure activity but did display decreases in neuronal activity and excitatory synaptic transmission ( Shin et al . , 2019 ) . Additionally , a close electrophysical investigation of hippocampi from these mice revealed that"}
