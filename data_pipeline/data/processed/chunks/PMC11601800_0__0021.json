It has yet to be determined which background strain most accurately and reliably recapitulates human symptomatology of Scn2a - related disorders . SCN2A - related disorders can drastically change a child ’ s quality of life ; therefore , it is imperative to determine the varying pathologies and prognoses enumerated by SCN2A variants . Currently , it is thought that SCN2A - related disorders bifurcate into two categories : neurodevelopmental disorders caused by LOF or seizure disorders caused by GOF in Nav1 . 2 . GOF mutations often result in early - onset seizure disorders ( Berecki et al . , 2022 ; Lauxmann et al . , 2018 ) , while LOF mutations are linked to diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) and / or intellectual disability ( ID ) and other neuropsychiatric conditions ( Ben - Shalom et al . , 2017 ) . While this binary organization has simplified the classification of Nav1 . 2 channel function , it does not fully capture the nuances of SCN2A - related disorders . Although LOF variants are largely associated with ASD and ID , an estimated 30 % of individuals with LOF mutations develop severe seizure disorders that are often intractable ( Reynolds et al . , 2020 ; Thompson et al . , 2020 ) . Data from LOF SCN2A models indicate that compensatory and maladaptive changes in potassium channels can lead to the onset of seizures ( Spratt et al . , 2021 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . There are also LOF variants that lead to the development of seizures prior to 3 months of age in humans , including p . R853Q , p . G899S , and p . P1658S ( Berecki et al . , 2018 ; Miao et al . , 2020 ; Wolff et al . , 2017 ) . As the age of seizure onset does not always align with the true electrophysical profile of the channel variant , ( Berecki et al . , 2022 ) ) argued that it should not be the sole classifier of an SCN2A channel variant . Furthermore , misassignment of the GOF or LOF label to a SCN2A channel variant can be detrimental as treatment of a LOF variant with sodium channel blockers can exacerbate seizures and lead to unfavorable outcomes for the affected individual ( Miao et al . , 2020 ; Oyrer et al . , 2018 , p . 8 ; Reynolds et al . , 2020 ; Thompson et al . , 2020 ) . Additionally , the age of onset and the electrophysical properties of SCN2A GOF channel variants are poor predictors of severity of seizures , suggesting we should seek better biomarkers of disease progression and severity ( Berecki et al . , 2022 ; Crawford et al . , 2021 ; Lauxmann et al . , 2018 ) . Human data also indicate that identical channel variants can lead to different phenotypes and diagnoses across individuals ( Berecki et al . , 2022 ; Passi & Mohammad , 2021 ) . For instance , the autosomal dominant SCN2A variant p . L1650P presented in a male child as episodic ataxia but in the father as episodic hemiplegia , two very distinct diagnoses ( Passi & Mohammad , 2021 ) . Similarly , the variants p . R1319Q and p . V261M lead to severe developmental delay in some individuals , while others with the variants have typical"}
