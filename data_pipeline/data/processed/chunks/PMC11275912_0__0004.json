A549 ( ATCC - CCL 185 ) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) and 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin mixture ( GM ) at 37 ° C in 5 % CO2 until they reached approximately 80 % confluency . Cells were washed with PBS once , trypsinized , resuspended in GM , and plated in 6 - well plates for assays . Min6 ( mouse insulinoma ) cells were cultured in DMEM medium ( 25 mM glucose ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 IU / mL penicillin and 100 μg / mL streptomycin , and 0 . 05 mM β - mercaptoethanol ( GM6 ) . Neonatal primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from C57B6 / J mice ( post - natal day 1 – 3 ) as previously described25 . Non - adherent cardiomyocytes were washed from the dish and re - plated in collagen pre - coated 96 - well plates . Isolated cells were maintained in plating medium for 24 hours . Cells were grown in 6 - well plates . After the cells reached approximately 60 % confluency , GM was removed , and cells were incubated for 15 , 30 , 45 and 60 mins in sterile PBS to assess BiP AMPylation levels . When working with compounds , we preincubated cells with molecules C55 , C83 , C84 , C522 , C22 , C73 and C34 in GM for approximately 12 hours . GM was removed and cells were exposed to PBS supplemented with the compounds for 60 mins . Cells preincubated with 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) DMSO in GM or PBS served as negative controls . When determining whether preincubation was sufficient for affecting BiP AMPylation , we preincubated cells with either 10 μM FICD inhibitors ( C22 or C73 ) or DMSO , and subsequently exposed the cells to PBS for another 60 minutes supplemented with either the FICD inhibitors or DMSO only . When determining whether supplementing FICD inhibitors in PBS is sufficient and necessary to affect BiP AMPylation , we did not preincubate the cells with compounds . Instead , cells were grown in GM until they reached approximately 70 % confluency . Then , GM was removed , and PBS was added to the cells for 60 mins . FICD inhibitors or DMSO were added to PBS at 0 ( immediately ) , 15 and 30 mins post PBS addition . Cells were grown to approximately 70 % confluency . Next , cells were incubated with sterile PBS for 60 mins . Post incubation , PBS was removed , and GM was added for 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 and 15 mins . When working with FICD inhibitors , cells were incubated for 5 or 15 mins in GM supplemented with either 10 μM compounds ( C22 or C73 ) or 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) DMSO . Post GM incubation , cells were washed once with PBS to remove residual GM . In all experiments , post incubation , cells were harvested and sonicated in cell - lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 2 mM EDTA and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail ) . The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10000x g for 10 mins at 4 ° C . The supernatant was"}
