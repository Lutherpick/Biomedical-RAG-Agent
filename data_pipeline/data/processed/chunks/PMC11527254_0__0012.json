The 20 - μg dose of 6 - OHDA accelerated the decrease in TH - IF , with reductions observed on days 7 and 14 ( Fig . 7D ) . Thus , in male mice , 6 - OHDA consistently reduced TH + cell abundance and TH expression in the SNpc at day 14 across all dosages , representing a decrease of ~ 75 % for stereologically counted TH + cells ( Fig . 6C – E ) and ~ 50 % for mean fluorescent intensity ( Fig . 7B – D ) . Stereological cell counting in the SNpc of female mice demonstrated their resilience to 6 - OHDA toxicity , with none of the 6 - OHDA dosages significantly affecting the TH + cell population ( Fig . 6B , I – K ) . Similarly , the Nissl + cell population remained unaffected ( Fig . 6L – N ) , and changes in the mean TH - IF intensity in the SNpc were modest ( Fig . 7E – H ) . An overall drug effect was detected for the 5 μg ( F ( 3 , 15 ) = 5 . 073 , p = 0 . 013 ) and 20 μg ( F ( 3 , 14 ) = 8 . 399 , p = 0 . 0019 ) 6 - OHDA dosages ( Fig . 7E – H ) . While TH - IF labeling was reduced at day 14 ( Fig . 7H ) , the reduction was not as pronounced as in male mice ( Fig . 7D ) . Both measurements in the SNpc generally showed similar temporal patterns of neurotoxicity across doses . They were significantly correlated with each other , with a Pearson ’ s correlation coefficient of 0 . 558 for males and 0 . 267 for females ( Table S5 ) . In male mice , there were small but significant correlations between the SNpc measurements and striatal TH protein levels . However , in female mice , striatal TH protein expression did not correlate with either histological endpoint , consistent with milder pathology . In the region where 6 - OHDA was infused , western blotting revealed clear evidence of inflammation three days later , as indicated by an upregulation of microglial markers CD68 ( t = 3 . 77 , df = 13 , p = 0 . 0024 ) , Iba1 ( t = 2 . 60 , df = 13 , p = 0 . 022 ) , and Lamp - 1 ( t = 3 . 23 , df = 13 , p = 0 . 0066 ) as well as the astrocytic marker GFAP ( t = 11 . 72 , df = 12 , p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 8A – E ; Fig . S8 ) . We analyzed 48 cytokines and chemokines in the SNpc with a 48 - plex assay following infusion of 20 μg of 6 - OHDA into the dorsal striatum of male C57BL / 6 mice . The expression of 11 neuroinflammatory markers was altered , as indicated by Log2 - fold change analysis , with tissue collection on days 1 , 3 , and 7 following 6 - OHDA infusion ( Fig . 8F – H ) . Multiple chemokines were upregulated across time points , indicating the"}
