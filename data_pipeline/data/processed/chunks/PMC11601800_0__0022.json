L1650P presented in a male child as episodic ataxia but in the father as episodic hemiplegia , two very distinct diagnoses ( Passi & Mohammad , 2021 ) . Similarly , the variants p . R1319Q and p . V261M lead to severe developmental delay in some individuals , while others with the variants have typical development ( Zeng et al . , 2022 ) . Likewise , the variants p . R102X and p . R1435X led to seizures in some individuals but no seizures in others ( Begemann et al . , 2019 ; Kamiya et al . , 2004 ; Trump et al . , 2016 ; Wolff et al . , 2017 ) . Currently , it is unclear what drives the differences between individuals with identical channel variants , but it is clear that the consequences of channel variants are not fully explained by the variants themselves . Patients with similar or identical pathogenic variants should undergo whole genome and / or epigenome sequencing as their unique genetic and epigenetic profiles could explain at least in part their dissimilar symptomology . Data from Scn2a mouse models support the idea that genetic modifiers can drive symptom presentation and severity , but genetic modifiers have not been explored in humans ( Bergren et al . , 2005 , 2009 ; Calhoun et al . , 2016 ; Hawkins & Kearney , 2016 ; MacDonald et al . , 2004 ; Passi & Mohammad , 2021 ; Thompson et al . , 2017 ) . There are also now reports of SCN2A variants displaying both GOF and LOF characteristics , defying categorization by the binary system . For instance , the p . K1422E variant located on the channel pore of Nav1 . 2 displays mixed biophysical characteristics to the extent that the authors who originally characterized the variant were not comfortable assigning it a classification ( Echevarria - Cooper et al . , 2022 ) . Another variant , p . G879R , was found to have a largely LOF profile but with an increased degree of overlap between the activation and inactivation of sodium channel currents typical of a GOF channel variant ( Yang et al . , 2022 ) . The biophysical profile of a channel variant can also shift depending on the SCN2A isoform present , like in the case of p . R1882L and p . R1882Q ( Thompson et al . , 2023 ) . Both variants display GOF characteristics while neonatal Nav1 . 2 is expressed but display mixed biophysical properties when the adult isoform replaces the neonatal ( Thompson et al . , 2023 ) . Data from individuals with SCN2A - related disorders , SeLFNIE ( previously BFNIS ) , further highlight the influence that SCN2A isoforms have on pathogenic variant symptom presentation ( Xu et al . , 2007 ) . These individuals usually experience typical development and display early - onset seizures that attenuate with age ( Xu et al . , 2007 ) . From non - human mammalian models , we can garner that this is likely due to the different electrophysical properties of the neonatal and adult channel isoforms ( Gazina et al . , 2015 ) . The pathogenic SCN2A variants leading to SeLFNIE likely cause the neonatal Nav1 . 2 isoform to behave more like the adult isoform . Therefore , when the adult isoform replaces the neonatal , the biophysical properties of the Nav1 . 2 channel likely better match the developmental state of the individual and"}
