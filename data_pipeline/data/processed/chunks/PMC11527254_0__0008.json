Voxels external to atlas labels or inside ventricles , the olfactory bulb , or undefined regions were excluded from voxel - wise comparisons . To map voxels with potential differences in TH - IF , the randomise_parallel function from FSL carried out voxel - wise , GLM - based , non - parametric , permutation testing according to a 2 × 2 ANOVA design ( 18 , 000 permutations ) . Voxels reaching significance ( uncorrected p < 0 . 05 ) for the main effect of side , the main effect of treatment , or interactions between these factors were further evaluated with post hoc voxel - wise t - tests ( 18 , 000 permutations ) . These pair - wise comparisons were made : ipsilateral vs . contralateral for 6 - OHDA - treated mice , ipsilateral vs . contralateral for vehicle - treated mice , 6 - OHDA vs . vehicle for the ipsilateral side , and 6 - OHDA vs . vehicle for the contralateral side . To control for type - I errors , statistical stringency was adjusted using false discovery rate ( FDR ) correction30 as per Eq . ( 1 ) . For each contrast , we selected q values that provided the maximum allowable stringency while permitting clusters of at least 100 significant voxels to survive , as described previously . 21 Although increasing specificity in this way can reduce sensitivity — potentially leading to type - II errors — we chose to prioritize highlighting data in which we have the highest confidence . Statistical comparisons , effect directions , FDR q values , adjusted p - value thresholds , and cluster validation rates are listed in Table S2 . Order voxel - wise p - values from smallest to largest . Sequentially check if each p - value with meets the following constraint , starting with the least significant ( largest ) p - value : where : pi is the nth p value , i is the index of the nth p - value , m is the total number of voxel - wise comparisons , q is the FDR q value The adjusted p - value threshold is identified by the first p - value that meets this condition . Cluster validation was based on prior work . 21 Clusters of voxels surviving FDR correction were partitioned for TH + cell density measurements in regions with dopamine or norepinephrine neurons and TH + fiber density measurements in the remainder of clusters . Clusters were warped to full - resolution tissue space for density measurements . Clusters were cropped and binarized for volume calculations . Cells and fibers were segmented in raw immunofluorescence images using Ilastik , where random forest classifiers were trained on all features by annotating 3 samples per condition ( 12 slices per label ) . 31 Cell or fiber segmentations were multiplied by cluster masks to nullify external voxels . Cells were counted with CLIJ ’ s 3D objects counter on the GPU ( 2 . 2 . 0 ) . TH + fiber density was defined as ( ( # of voxels segmented as TH + fibers ) / ( total # of voxels in the cluster ) ) * 100 . 32 Clusters were considered valid if an unpaired , two - tailed t"}
