The expression of 11 neuroinflammatory markers was altered , as indicated by Log2 - fold change analysis , with tissue collection on days 1 , 3 , and 7 following 6 - OHDA infusion ( Fig . 8F – H ) . Multiple chemokines were upregulated across time points , indicating the consistency of these measurements . The effect of 6 - OHDA on cytokines was analyzed using a mixed - effect model , followed by post hoc Šídák ’ s correction for multiple comparisons . Figure 8I – S details the chemokines / cytokines that were significantly altered for at least one time point . A sustained increase in expression was observed for MCP - 1 / CCL2 , MCP - 3 / CCL7 , and MIP - 1β across time points . Other markers were increased at the latter two - time points ( IL - 18 , IL - 22 , IP - 10 / CXCL10 , and RANTES / CCL5 ) . IL - 9 was only increased on day 1 , and BAFF / TNFSF - 13B and MIP - 1a / CCL3 were only increased on day 3 . VEGF was the only cytokine that decreased significantly ( day 7 ) . The upregulation of MCP - 1 / CCL2 , MCP - 3 / CCL7 , and MIP - 1β may drive immune cell recruitment , microglial proliferation , and inflammatory gene expression . Delayed increases in IL - 18 , IL - 22 , IP - 10 / CXCL10 , and RANTES / CCL5 suggest a progression of chronic neuroinflammation , while early IL - 9 and mid - stage BAFF / TNFSF - 13B and MIP - 1a / CCL3 increases may reflect an evolving response . The decrease in VEGF at day 7 may improve blood - brain barrier integrity and aid the resolution of immune cell recruitment . After profiling the inflammatory response in the nigrostriatal tract , we investigated the phosphorylation status of multiple kinases in the striatum seven days after a 20 μg 6 - OHDA infusion to examine the engagement of specific biochemical signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis . Death - associated protein kinase 1 ( DAPK1 ) , which is typically auto - phosphorylated at Ser308 to autoinhibit its CaM binding site and remain inactivated , showed a reduction in the ratio of phosphorylated DAPK1 ( pDAPK1 ) to total DAPK ( t = 2 . 34 , df = 15 , p = 0 . 033 ; Figs . S9 A and B ; S10 ) . This reduction indicates local excitotoxicity and / or pro - apoptotic signaling in the axons of SNpc neurons . 33 , 34 Conversely , phosphorylation of GSK - 3β at Thr390 relative to total GSK - 3β was increased ( Figs . S9 A and C ; S10 ) , suggesting that it was inactive and did not promote pro - apoptotic signaling . Phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 increased slightly but not significantly , which might reflect a modest role in promoting cellular survival . Together , these findings characterize the profile of inflammatory and apoptotic signaling induced by 6 - OHDA toxicity . In this study , we investigated the histopathological effects of 6 - OHDA infusion into the striatum of C57BL / 6 mice . Using a novel image analysis technique to map brain - wide changes in TH expression and relate these to TH + neuron and projection densities , we found that neurodegeneration from"}
