FICDE234G enzyme was then incubated with compounds or 1 % ( v / v ) DMSO ( positive control ) for 10 – 15 mins at room temperature ( RT ) . The Pintool Sciclone ALHD 3000 ( Perkin Elmer ) equipment was used to transfer 200 nL of DMSO - dissolved compounds from 2 mM source plates into 384 - well black , flat - bottom , black - walled microplates , to obtain a final concentration of 20 μM in a total volume of 20 μL . 5120 compounds were sourced from the repurposing library ( FDA approved drugs for other indications ) maintained by the Centre for Chemical Genomics ( CCG ) at the University of Michigan . The compounds were added to columns 3 – 22 of each plate . Lastly , the multidrop reagent dispenser was used to pipette 1 μL FL - ATP ( final concentration of 250 nM ) into the whole plate . Plates were then incubated for 60 mins at 37 ° C in the dark . Post incubation , plates were loaded onto a BioTek stacker and scanned using the BMG Pherastar plate - reader , in succession , to obtain fluorescence polarization values using 485 / 530 nm filters . Z ’ and S / B ( signal / background ) values were determined by fitting the data to Equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively , Equation 1 : Z ′ = 1 − 3 ( σp + σn ) abs ( μp - μn ) Equation 2 : SB = μpμn where μp and σp are the means and the standard deviations of the positive control samples and μn and σn are the means and the standard deviations of the negative control samples , respectively . A Multidrop nano 384 - well reagent dispenser was used to pipette 1 μM FICDE234G ( positive control ) or WT FICD dissolved in AMPylation buffer into designated microplate wells which already contained either 200nL of DMSO - dissolved compounds or an equivalent volume of 1 % DMSO , respectively . Each compound was used at eight concentrations determined in accordance with semi - log fold dilutions starting from 30 nM . The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 – 15 mins at RT . 1 μL FL - ATP ( final concentration of 250 nM ) was dispensed using the automated reagent dispenser into the whole plate which was incubated for 90 mins at 37 ° C in the dark . They were subsequently transferred to the BMG Pherastar plate - reader fitted with 485 / 530 nm filters to record fluorescence polarization . The same setup was used to obtain concentration - response curves for the commercially obtained Closantel analogs . IC50 values were determined by fitting polarization values to Equation ( 3 ) , Y = 1001 + 10 ( LogIC50 − X ) ∗ HillSlope where Y is the polarization signal ; X is the log concentration of inhibitor ( μM ) and IC50 is concentration of the inhibitor that elicits a response halfway between Bottom and Top . This is not the same as the response at Y = 50 . HillSlope describes the steepness of the family of curves . A549 ( ATCC - CCL 185 ) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) and 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin mixture ( GM ) at 37 ° C in 5 % CO2 until they reached"}
