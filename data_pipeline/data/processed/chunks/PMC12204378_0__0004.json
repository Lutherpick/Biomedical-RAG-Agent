EPSCs from PCs of the vulnerable lobules VI / VII in SMNΔ7 mice were reduced by ~ 50 % ( Fig . 3H , I ) , consistent with dysfunction and loss of VGLUT1 + synapses from parallel fibers ( Fig . 3B ) . To dissect pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms for the weakening of parallel fiber synapeses , we measured the short - term plasticity . The EPSC amplitudes normalized to the first EPSC amplitude at the parallel fiber to PC synapses in lobules VI / VII increased from ~ 20 % in control mice to ~ 40 % in SMA mice ( Fig . 3H , J ) . The profound increase in the degree of synaptic facilitation indicates a reduced presynaptic release probability , which is consistent with the lower EPSC amplitudes as well as the increased facilitation due to less vesicle depletion54 . In contrast , SMA PCs in the resistant lobule III did not show differences in facilitation or EPSC amplitudes compared to control PCs ( Fig . S4I - K ) . Thus , the substantial loss of excitatory parallel fiber synapses may be further aggravated by reduced presynaptic neurotransmission in vulnerable lobules of severe SMA mice . To further evaluate the functional input of the cerebellum , we recorded the synaptic transmission between mossy fibers - originating from different nuclei of the vestibular system , cerebellar cortex , reticular formation , and spinal cord36 - and the GCs in the cerebellar cortex as the source of the parallel fibers . Although SMA GCs in vulnerable lobules had slightly smaller and wider AP ( Fig . S5A - D ) , all other passive and active functional properties were unaltered compared to control GCs ( Fig . S5E - N ) . Moreover , repetitive 100 - Hz - stimulation of mossy fibers resulted in similar short time depression in control and SMA GCs ( Fig . 5O – R ) , indicating that the mossy fiber to GC synapses , which mediate the main sensory input to the cerebellar cortex , is unaltered in SMA . Together , these findings highlight impairment of excitatory neurotransmission and degeneration of parallel fiber boutons , leading to reduced activation of PCs and diminished cerebellar output in SMA . Next , we sought out to identify potential behavioral consequences of cerebellar pathology in SMA mice . Interestingly , PC degeneration and hypoplasia specifically confined to vermal lobules VI and VII have previously been associated with neurodevelopmental delay in motor function , speech and cognition in both humans and mice55 – 60 . To assess neurodevelopmental delay in SMNΔ7 pups , we evaluated separation - induced ultrasonic vocalizations ( USVs ) ( Fig . 4A ) , which are functionally important signals that elicit maternal care . Deficits in USVs have been reported in various rodent models of neurodevelopmental disorders , particularly those modeling human communication impairments such as verbal dyspraxia and ASD37 , 61 – 63 . We found that the number of USV calls per 3 minutes in control mice peaked between P5 and P7 following a canonical inverted - U shape trajectory from P3 to P9 ( Fig . 4B , C ) , which is characteristic of normal WT pups63 , 64 . Conversely , SMA mice exhibited pronounced USV deficits , including an approximately 50 % reduction in call number at P5 and P7 ( Fig . 4B , C ) , displaying a stagnant trajectory reminiscent of that observed in"}
