Further research will be needed to illuminate how each subclass of L5 neurons , intratelencephalic or extratelencephalic , is involved . Bilateral injections of adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) expressing Cre recombinase were injected into Scn2afl / fl mice to selectively delete Scn2a from mPFC or VTA to elucidate the role of Nav1 . 2 in schizophrenia ( Suzuki et al . , 2023 ) . When Scn2a was depleted in the mPFC , prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) was reduced ; however , an increase in PPI response was found when Scn2a was depleted in the VTA ( Figure 4 , Supplemental Table 2 ) ( Suzuki et al . , 2023 ) . Additionally , deletion of Scn2a in the mPFC was found to increase social interaction and anxiety - like behaviors but decrease locomotion when compared to control - treated animals ; this effect was not seen when Scn2a was deleted in the VTA ( Figure 4 , Supplemental Table 2 ) ( Suzuki et al . , 2023 ) . AAV - EF1α - Cre - mCherry has also been utilized to delete Scn2a in mPFC and label excitatory cells in Scn2afl / fl mice to explore Nav1 . 2 function without a specific focus on schizophrenia ( Spratt et al . , 2021 ) . When Nav1 . 2 is deleted from mature cortical pyramidal cells in the mPFC , the cells become paradoxically hyperexcitable ( Spratt et al . , 2021 ) . However , these cortical neurons also had a hypoexcitable response for dendritic backpropagation , which impaired axonal repolarization ( Spratt et al . , 2021 ) . Both the paradoxical hyperexcitability of the axon and the hypoexcitable dendritic backpropagation can be explained by Nav1 . 2 ’ s unique role in regulating somatodendritic excitability through potassium channel priming ( Spratt et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) . Reduced dendritic backpropagation results in fewer potassium channels opening to repolarize the neuron and establish a refractory period , thus allowing for more action potentials while impairing repolarization . This phenomenon noted in Nav1 . 2 deficient cells is likely one of the mechanisms in how LOF of Nav1 . 2 can lead to seizure disorders but does not necessarily explain how the loss of Nav1 . 2 contributes to other neuropsychiatric or developmental disorders . These studies highlight that although Scn2a likely has cell type , developmental stage , and brain region specific roles , the mechanism of how Nav1 . 2 contributes to such a heterogeneous group of neuropsychiatric disorders and symptoms requires further investigation . Another Scn2a + / fl mouse under the CaMKIIα - Cre driver removed exon 2 of the Scn2a gene ( Spratt et al . , 2019 ) around P10 . The Scn2a + / fl / CaMKII - Cre mice developed with standard action potential threshold and spike output ( Spratt et al . , 2019 ) . At P10 , the animals start expressing cre in neocortical pyramidal cells and can then be manipulated for Scn2a knockdown ( Spratt et al . , 2019 ) . If knockdown was induced around P10 by P50 peak dV / dt overlapped with constitutive Scn2a + / − cells ( Spratt et al . , 2019 ) . Ex - vivo culture of pyramidal cells from the model identified impaired dendritic excitability and action potential backpropagation even when haploinsufficiency was induced around P50 ( Spratt et al . , 2021 ) . Additionally , conditional deletion of Scn2a in either parvalbumin or somatostatin"}
