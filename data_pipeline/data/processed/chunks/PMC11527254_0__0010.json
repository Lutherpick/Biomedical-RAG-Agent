Table S3 provides information on regional abbreviations and valid clusters ’ significance , volumes , position , and regional composition . Raw TH + cell and fiber densities and p - values are provided in Table S4 . Fly - through videos created with Imaris showcase representative examples of TH - IF in lesioned ( Video S1 ) and control ( Video S2 ) mice . In regions housing dopamine neurons , only one cluster reflected TH + cell loss when comparing the hemispheres of 6 - OHDA - treated mice or the ipsilateral hemisphere of treatment groups ( Fig . 2 ; q < 0 . 0005 ) . In both cases , the loss of dopamine neurons was primarily concentrated in the SNpc ( 6 - OHDA : ipsilateral vs . contralateral , p = 0 . 00049 ; Ipsilateral : vehicle vs . 6 - OHDA , p = 0 . 00062 ) . Consistent with these findings , region - wise TH + cell density measurements in dopaminergic cell groups also indicated selective loss of neurons in the SNpc ( p < 0 . 0015 ; Tukey ’ s post - test comparing contralateral and ipsilateral sides of 6 - OHDA - infused mice ; Fig . S3 ) . No TH + cell loss was observed in noradrenergic regions with either cluster - wise or region - wise analyses ( Fig . S4 ) . 6 - OHDA induced widespread loss of TH + fibers in both the infused and contralateral hemispheres ( Fig . 3 and Fig . S5 ) . Ipsilateral fiber loss was most prominent in the striatum ( e . g . , caudoputamen , olfactory tubercle , and nucleus accumbens ) , olfactory regions ( e . g . , piriform cortex ) , isocortex , hippocampal formation , basolateral / basomedial amygdala , pallidum , and substantia nigra , pars reticulata ( SNr ) . Fiber loss was predominantly cortical in the contralateral hemisphere , with notable decreases in retrosplenial , somatosensory , motor , visual , and hippocampal areas . Compensatory increases in TH + fiber density were most evident on the ipsilateral side . However , they were also observed in a subset of the same regions in the contralateral hemisphere ( Fig . 4 ) . The primary regions displaying ipsilateral compensation included the thalamus ( e . g . , the reticular nucleus and ventral medial nucleus ) , zona incerta , and midbrain reticular nucleus . When comparing 6 - OHDA and vehicle - treated brains , fiber density increased bilaterally in the lateral / medial septal nucleus , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , hypothalamus , and thalamus . 3D patterns of TH + cell loss , TH + fiber loss , and upregulation of TH in projection sites are summarized in Video S3 . To better understand the neurotoxic effects of 6 - OHDA , we examined how dosage and sex influence the extent and progression of 6 - OHDA - induced lesions . Lesion extent was assessed using western blotting to measure striatal TH protein levels , stereological counts of TH + cells , and mean fluorescent intensity of TH levels in the SNpc . TH protein levels in the striatum of male mice showed a gradual decrease in dopaminergic fibers over 14 days following a 5 μg"}
