Although robustly characterized , there are some conflicting behavioral results from the various studies utilizing the model . For instance , Tatsukawa et al . , 2019 found that Scn2a + / − mice were hypersocial compared to their wildtype littermate controls and Marcantonio et al . , 2023 identified a similar phenotype in juvenile female Scn2a + / − mice . However , Léna and Mantegazza , 2019 , found mild social behavior deficits in juvenile male Scn2a + / − mice that attenuated with age . Some studies also found no differences between the sociability of Scn2a + / − mice and their littermate controls ( Indumathy et al . , 2021 ; Spratt et al . , 2019 ) . A summary of general behavioral findings from the ( Planells - Cases et al . , 2000 ) Scn2a + / − mouse model is provided in Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 2 . When first characterized , it was thought that Scn2a + / − mice did not experience seizures ( Misra et al . , 2008 ; Planells - Cases et al . , 2000 ) , but recently , electrographic spontaneous absence - like seizures have been reported in Scn2a + / − mice ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ; Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . The authors suggested that the ” outwardly healthy appearance ” of the mice could be why past seizure activity had been undetected ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ) . Now there are also reported cases of this model having convulsive seizures : Schamiloglu et al . , 2023 identified 16 % of Scn2a + / − mice actively seizing at the end of a dynamic foraging behavior task . The mice used in the task had restricted water consumption before testing , which could have induced the seizures ( Schamiloglu et al . , 2023 ) . This raises the possibility that the severity and type of seizure endured by Scn2a + / − mice can be modulated by experience . Beyond seizures , the Planells - Cases Scn2a + / − mice have been found to have slower and more broad action potential generation , at least in the first postnatal week ( Miyamoto et al . , 2019 ; Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ; Spratt et al . , 2019 ; Tamura et al . , 2022 ) . Additionally , immature glutamatergic cortical neurons from Scn2a + / − mice display decreased neuronal excitability , but mature neurons from these animals are hyperexcitable ( Spratt et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) . These findings indicate that impairments in action potential depolarization and cell excitability may depend on developmental stage . Additionally , partial loss of Nav1 . 2 impaired cortical - striatal firing and may contribute to the identified seizures through maladaptive changes in the cortical - striatal circuit ( Hu et al . , 2009 ; Ogiwara et al . , 2018 ) . Haploinsufficiency of Nav1 . 2 also impaired dendritic excitability and backpropagation , which can further alter neuron repolarization and activity ( Nelson et al . , 2024 ) . Overall , constitutive Scn2a haploinsufficiency appears to impair excitatory cortical neurons in a developmental stage - specific manner and increases seizure susceptibility , although the precise mechanism linking these changes remains unknown .
