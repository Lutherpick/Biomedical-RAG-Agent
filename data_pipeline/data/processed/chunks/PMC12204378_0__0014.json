Righting time was defined as the time required for a pup to roll onto all four limbs after being placed on its back , maintaining this position for at least 3 seconds . Posture time measured how long a pup could sustain its balance while standing on all four limbs . The tests had a maximum duration of 60 seconds as indicated in the figure . Equal numbers of male and female mice were included , and data were combined , as no sex - specific differences were observed or have been previously reported in SMA . The self - complementary AAV9 - GFP , AAV9 - STAS and AAV9 - p53shRNA vectors were previously described18 , 19 . For virus production , AAV - vectors were generated using a three plasmid standard protocol as previously reported106 , 107 with pDGdeltaVP providing helper sequences , and a distinct rep - cap - helper plasmid with AAV9 wild - type capsid genes . Briefly , HEK293T cells were seeded in 15cm cell culture dishes and grown in DMEM + 1 % Pen / Strep + 10 % FBS till 70 % confluence , and then transfected with 2μgDNA / 1000bp using the PEI transfection reagent . Cells were harvested 3 days later , suspended in lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris - Cl , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgClm with 2x Roche protease and phosphatase inhibitors cocktails added ) and lysed by repeated freeze - thaw cycles ; debris were cleared by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min . The AAV fraction was purified from the raw cell lysate by layering on an Optiprep discontinuous gradient 60 / 40 / 20 / 15 % in PBS + Mg / K and centrifuging at 350 . 000 × g 10 ° C for 90 min . The AAV fraction concentrated in the 40 % Optiprep band was subject to de - salting in Zeba columns ( Zeba Spin Desalting Columns , 10ml , 40 . 000 MWCO , Thermo 87772 ) further concentrated using centrifugal concentrators ( Vivaspin 6 , 100 . 000 MWCO Filter , GE Healthcare 28932319 ) at 4000 × g 4 ° C for 10 min , repeated till the full volume was concentrated . Viral titer was determined by qPCR with primers directed against ITR , as previously described106 . The plasmid for the AAV9 - Bcl - xL was a kind gift from Robert Nickells . The mCherry - BclxL sequence under the control of the ubiquitous PGK promoter has been described previously75 . The purified AAV9 - Bcl - xL virus was produced by Vector Builder . The plasmid for the AAV9 - L7 - 6 - GFP are available from AddGene ( Plasmid # 126462 ) 76 . The GFP was replaced by DNA fragments corresponding to the open reading frame of human SMN and packed into an AAV9 by Vector Builder . For immunostaining of human cerebellar vermis , following parental - or patient - informed consent in strict observance of the legal and institutional ethical regulations , human tissues were collected at autopsy procedure at the Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD , USA or was obtained from the NIH Neurobiobank at the University of Maryland , Baltimore , MD , USA ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Human cerebellum tissue was cryoprotected with a 15 % sucrose solution for at least 2 h until the tissue sank to the bottom of the tube . Afterwards , the tissue was transferred to a 30 %"}
