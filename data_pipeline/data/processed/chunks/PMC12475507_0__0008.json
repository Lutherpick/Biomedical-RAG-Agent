This result suggests that the model is capable of detecting ischemic events shortly after onset . Future work may aim to collect EEG data during the first hour post ‐ stroke to determine whether detection can be pushed even earlier , potentially enhancing clinical decision ‐ making in ultra ‐ early stroke care . Previous applications of EEG in acute ischemic stroke have primarily focused on analyzing spectral power and the Brain Symmetry Index ( BSI ) [ 12 ] . These studies typically require significant time and effort for analysis , necessitating specialized expertise for analysis and interpretation . Moreover , the results lack sufficient specificity , with discrepancies observed across different studies , making it challenging to establish a unified standard or diagnostic marker . This is also the primary reason why EEG data is challenging to use in acute stroke diagnosis . In this study , we applied the EEGNet deep learning algorithm to construct a diagnostic model based on hyper ‐ acute mouse EEG data . Compared to traditional diagnostic methods , this model not only has the capability to capture subtle and complex signal variations while extracting high ‐ dimensional latent features from temporal data , but also streamlines the processing workflow , allowing for results to be obtained simply by inputting EEG data , thereby reducing the need for specialized knowledge in EEG analysis [ 23 , 33 , 34 ] . This ability opens new avenues for dynamic monitoring and classification of stroke states , laying a foundation for the future development of non ‐ invasive , real ‐ time stroke diagnostic tools with significant clinical utility . Specifically , the proposed EEGNet ‐ based model demonstrates strong translational potential . EEG is a non ‐ invasive , widely available neuroimaging modality , and its portability makes it particularly well ‐ suited for prehospital stroke screening [ 7 , 17 , 18 ] . The compact architecture and low computational latency of EEGNet further support its integration into edge devices or portable EEG systems for use in emergency scenarios . Although our current study is based on the pMCAO mouse model , EEG biomarkers of cerebral ischemia , such as focal slowing and spectral power alterations , are well ‐ established in early human stroke , offering a physiological foundation for translational application [ 12 ] . Future work will focus on adapting and validating the model using human EEG datasets collected during the hyper ‐ acute phase of stroke in both clinical and prehospital settings . Furthermore , with ongoing advancements in portable EEG technologies and wearable brain ‐ monitoring systems , it is now feasible to acquire EEG data in mobile or ambulance ‐ based environments . Given EEGNet ' s lightweight structure and compatibility with low ‐ power hardware , the proposed model can be seamlessly integrated into real ‐ time processing pipelines for stroke triage [ 23 , 33 ] . Such integration could facilitate earlier diagnosis and transport decisions , ultimately reducing treatment delays and improving patient outcomes . Given the relatively small sample size in this study , we implemented 7 ‐ fold cross ‐ validation to ensure the reliability of the experimental results and the generalizability of the model . In the 7 ‐ fold cross ‐ validation process , the stroke dataset was randomly divided into seven subsets . Six of these subsets were used for model training , while the"}
