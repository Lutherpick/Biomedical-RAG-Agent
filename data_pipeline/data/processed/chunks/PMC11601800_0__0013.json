Elevation of Cav3 . 1 correlated with increased spontaneous seizure activity , while a decrease in Cav3 . 1 correlated with decreased seizure activity ( Calhoun et al . , 2016 ) . Cacna1g could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Scn2a - related epilepsies that do not respond to sodium or potassium channel blockers . Hepatic leukemia factor ( Hlf ) is another genetic modifier of seizures in Scn2aQ54 mice ( Hawkins & Kearney , 2016 ) . Deletion of Hlf in B6 . Scn2aQ54 mice augments the seizure phenotype ( Hawkins & Kearney , 2016 ) . Hlf is a regulator of the pyridoxine pathway , and it was postulated that deletion of Hlf exacerbated the severity of seizures through dysregulation of the pathway . When fed a diet deficient in pyridoxine , the number and severity of seizures of the B6 . Scn2aQ54 mice also increased ( Hawkins & Kearney , 2016 ) . These findings reveal pyridoxine as a regulator of seizure severity in this mouse model ( Hawkins & Kearney , 2016 ) . Calmodulin protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) , a modulator of persistent current and channel inactivation , alters and likely indicates seizure severity of SCN2A - related seizures ( Thompson et al . , 2017 ) . Higher levels of CaMKII were found in hippocampal lysates from the F1 . Scn2aQ54 mice ( more severe phenotype ) compared to B6 . Scn2aQ54mice ( attenuated phenotype ) ( Thompson et al . , 2017 ) . Both Scn2aQ54 lines , however , had elevated levels of CaMKII present compared to wildtype , which indicates that CaMKII levels rise in response to increased Nav1 . 2 activity . Lastly , inhibition of CaMKII in either F1 . Scn2aQ54 or B6 . Scn2aQ54 mice reduced neuronal excitability and persistent currents , improving the seizure phenotype ( Thompson et al . , 2017 ) . The identification of multiple modifiers of Scn2a - related seizures in mice can uncover potential new targets for the treatment of SCN2A - related seizure disorders . Beyond Scn2aQ54 , there are at least two other GOF Scn2a mouse models , both of which model human variants . The first is the Scn2aA263V / + mouse , which displays increased activity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons ( Schattling et al . , 2016 ) . The Scn2aA263V / + model was specifically developed to better understand sodium channel involvement in autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) which leads to gradual disability through neuron loss ( Schattling et al . , 2016 ) . The p . A263V mutant allele compounded the effect of EAE by increasing Nav1 . 2 activity , leading to greater axonal injury and energy consumption ( Schattling et al . , 2016 ) . These changes were noted in both sexes but were most prominent in male mice ( Schattling et al . , 2016 ) . The p . A263V variant also exacerbated neurodegeneration associated with multiple sclerosis ( Fazeli et al . , 2016 ) . The other existing GOF model emulating a human variant is the Scn2aQ / + mouse ( M . Li et al . , 2021 ) . The Scn2aQ / + mouse was generated by inserting the point mutation p . 1883Q into exon 26 of the Scn2a gene . These mice displayed phenotypes consistent with developmental epileptic encephalopathy and were not viable after P30 due to frequent seizure activity ( M . Li et al . , 2021 ) . Overall ,"}
