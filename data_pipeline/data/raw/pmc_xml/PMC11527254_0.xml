Among PD models, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) infusion in mice has gained prominence since 2012, primarily focusing on the nigrostriatal region. This study characterized widespread tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron and fiber loss across the brain following a unilateral 6-OHDA (20 &#956;g) infusion into the dorsal striatum. Our analysis integrates immunolabeling, brain clearing (iDISCO+), light sheet microscopy, and computational methods, including fMRI and machine learning tools. We also examined sex differences, disease progression, neuroinflammatory responses, and pro-apoptotic signaling in nigrostriatal regions of C57BL/6 mice exposed to varying 6-OHDA dosages (5, 10, or 20 &#956;g). This comprehensive, spatiotemporal analysis of 6-OHDA-induced pathology may guide the future design of experimental PD studies and neurotherapeutic development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Parkinson&#8217;s disease</kwd><kwd>6-OHDA</kwd><kwd>Dopamine</kwd><kwd>Striatum</kwd><kwd>Substantia Nigra</kwd><kwd>Locus Coeruleus</kwd><kwd>Dopaminergic projections</kwd><kwd>Stereology cell counting</kwd><kwd>iDISCO+</kwd><kwd>LSFM</kwd><kwd>Cytokines/chemokine</kwd><kwd>Dopaminergic lesion</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) presents pathological characteristics that are challenging to fully replicate in rodent and non-human primate models. PD is a multifaceted disorder encompassing motor and non-motor manifestations.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Neurodegeneration and aggregation of Lewy bodies (LB) extend well beyond the nigrostriatal tract,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> affecting various neurotransmitters such as dopamine,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> norepinephrine,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> serotonin,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and GABA.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Despite the limitations of modeling PD in small animals, the understanding of PD pathophysiology and cellular disease mechanisms have primarily been driven by animal models mirroring certain pathological aspects of the disease. However, such advancements have not translated into definitive treatments to cure or delay neurodegeneration in PD, with current therapeutic approaches primarily focused on symptomatic management.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Though numerous mouse models of PD have emerged over the years to elucidate PD&#8217;s cellular, genetic, and environmental aspects,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> only a handful can effectively serve as platforms for drug screening.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Notably, most preclinical drug testing relies on PD models that have been successfully used for more than four decades, i.e., systemic injection or local infusion of neurotoxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into rodents.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The neurotoxin 6-OHDA was first discovered in 1959 and employed by Ungerstedt in 1968 in rats as a catecholaminergic denervating agent.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In the present study, we chose the dorsal striatum as the site of infusion to achieve gradual and progressive loss of dopaminergic cells in a retrograde fashion as demonstrated elsewhere<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and avoid undesired effects such as high mortality, nonspecific toxicity, and acute neuronal loss arising from targeting regions such as the medial forebrain bundle, the ventricles, and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Existing reports guide the behavioral and histopathological phenotyping of 6-OHDA lesioned mice.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> For example, Stott et al. noted a swift loss of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) fibers, accompanied by TH + cell loss starting on day 6 and microglial proliferation on day 9 after the striatal convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of 10 &#956;g of 6-OHDA.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Similarly, Masini et al. offered comprehensive guidance on pre-and post-operative care to minimize mortality after bilateral infusion of 4 &#956;g of 6-OHDA. They also reported sex differences and cell loss in the SNpc and ventral tegmental area (VTA) regions.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">The primary aim of our study was to extensively characterize the histopathological and biochemical changes resulting from the unilateral infusion of 6-OHDA into the dorsal striatum (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In a first for this model, we mapped TH depletion in 3D across the whole brain by imaging immunolabeled solvent-cleared brains with light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and extending the quantitative functionality of UNRAVEL<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> to use voxel-wise maps of differential immunolabeling for precise TH + neuron projection mapping in the regions most severely affected by 6-OHDA. This innovation enabled us to visualize and quantify changes in TH + cell and fiber density unbiasedly in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of 6-OHDA-treated mice and a vehicle-infused control group. We also extensively assessed differences in neuronal damage between male and female C57BL/6 mice across three different dosages of 6-OHDA. Finally, we evaluated chemokine and cytokine expression in the SNpc while screening for pathologically relevant kinases and inflammatory markers in the striatum. 3D mapping highlighted the widespread loss of TH + projections in both hemispheres two weeks after a high dose of 6-OHDA (20 &#956;g), coupled with compensatory increases in TH expression in projections targeting subcortical regions. Voxel-wise and region-wise analyses indicated that the loss of catecholaminergic neurons is restricted to the SNpc. Our biochemical and 2D histological findings revealed significant disparities between male and female mice, with females exhibiting resistance to the effects of 6-OHDA. In male mice, the lowest dose of 6-OHDA (5 &#956;g) led to gradual striatal fiber loss (with measurements at days 1, 7, and 14), whereas the loss of TH + cells in the SNpc was only gradual for the highest dose (20 &#956;g). Correspondingly, several cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in the SNpc by the highest 6-OHDA dosage, consistent with SNpc degeneration. We also examined the infusion site for inflammatory marker expression and phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic kinases. Glial reactivity was observed early on, and pro-apoptotic signaling appeared specific to DAPK1, suggesting the involvement of this protein kinase in the pathophysiology associated with the loss of SNpc neurons. Our comprehensive characterization of the 6-OHDA mouse model expands our understanding of its pathology and may inform the development and screening of experimental therapeutics for neuroprotective and immunomodulatory treatments for Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title><p id="P6">Eight-week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Unless otherwise specified, animals were group-housed (four/five per cage) in environmentally controlled rooms (19.5&#8211;21.5&#176;C, 60&#8211;65% relative humidity) with a 12-hour reverse light/dark cycle (lights on at 8 p.m.). Mice were held in 100% PET disposable individually ventilated cages (IVC) with a filter cage IVC lid. The cages were docked into IVC Innoracks designed to offer continuous airflow within the cages and dual HEPA-filtered ventilation (Innovive). Cages were filled with ALPHA-dri bedding, and mice had free access to water and food (chow Teklad global 18% protein rodent diet). The Stanford University Administrative Panel approved all procedures and animal husbandry practices for Laboratory and Animal Care (APLAC) and adhered to the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Our laboratory is also compliant with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) standards and accredited by the AAALAC international accreditation program for the use of animals in research. Annual inspections are conducted throughout our facilities by both APLAC and AAALAC. Paper nestlets and cardboard tubes provided environment enrichment (1 cage change per week). Experimenters involved in histopathology assessment, Western blotting, and immune marker assays were blind to the treatment groups. Mice were identified with numerical IDs. Experimenters and animal caregivers were unblinded during animal surgeries and post-operative care procedures. Data analysis procedures were carried out in an unblinded fashion.

Mice were randomized into treatment groups based on their body weight and sex. Differences in the average body weight between groups were less than 1.5 grams. Group housing of 4/5 mice per cage was done to ensure even distribution of the control vehicle and 6-OHDA-infused mice in the same cage. To reduce stress levels, mice were handled for 4 days before surgical procedures. Mice were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane (Isothesia, Henry Schein Animal Health, Dublin, OH) in a mixture of oxygen and compressed air. The toe pinch reflex confirmed full anesthetic induction. Immediately after induction, mice received a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of USP solution (10 mL/kg) with 5% dextrose (Baxter, Deerfield, IL) and 1 mg/kg Buprenorphine SR<sup>&#8482;</sup> LAB (ZooPharm). Mice were shaved on top of the skull and positioned on a digital stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments), with isoflurane maintained at 1.5&#8211;2% throughout the surgery. Eye drops were applied to keep the cornea moisturized, and the skull surface was disinfected 3X with Betadine and 70% ethanol solution. An 8 mm median incision above the skull was topically anesthetized twice with 5 mg/mL lidocaine (Xylocain MPF, Fresenius Kabi, USA). Respiration rate, skin color, and toe-pinch reflex were monitored every 15 minutes, while normothermia was maintained through a heating pad (WPI, ATC2000) connected to a feedback loop rectal probe (WPI). After intracranial convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of 6-OHDA or vehicle, mice were placed in recovery cages and kept warm with heating pads, with free access to 98% water hydrogel (Clear H<sub>2</sub>O) for approximately 5 hours before returning to their home cage. Saline was administered s.c. every day for 5 consecutive days, with wetted food provided throughout the treatment period. Buprenorphine SR<sup>&#8482;</sup> LAB was administered every 48 hours to manage pain. Attrition rates ranged between 5 and 30% depending on the sex and dose of 6-OHDA infused.

IL-9 was only increased on day 1, and BAFF/TNFSF-13B and MIP-1a/CCL3 were only increased on day 3. VEGF was the only cytokine that decreased significantly (day 7). The upregulation of MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-3/CCL7, and MIP-1&#946; may drive immune cell recruitment, microglial proliferation, and inflammatory gene expression. Delayed increases in IL-18, IL-22, IP-10/CXCL10, and RANTES/CCL5 suggest a progression of chronic neuroinflammation, while early IL-9 and mid-stage BAFF/TNFSF-13B and MIP-1a/CCL3 increases may reflect an evolving response. The decrease in VEGF at day 7 may improve blood-brain barrier integrity and aid the resolution of immune cell recruitment.</p><p id="P40">After profiling the inflammatory response in the nigrostriatal tract, we investigated the phosphorylation status of multiple kinases in the striatum seven days after a 20 &#956;g 6-OHDA infusion to examine the engagement of specific biochemical signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis. Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), which is typically auto-phosphorylated at Ser308 to autoinhibit its CaM binding site and remain inactivated, showed a reduction in the ratio of phosphorylated DAPK1 (pDAPK1) to total DAPK (t = 2.34, df = 15, p = 0.033; <bold>Figs.

Using a novel image analysis technique to map brain-wide changes in TH expression and relate these to TH + neuron and projection densities, we found that neurodegeneration from 20 &#956;g 6-OHDA at 14 days post-infusion was confined to the SNpc and associated with widespread, bilateral denervation of its striatal and extra-nigrostriatal targets, along with compensatory TH upregulation in subcortical regions. Male mice showed more severe pathology, indicating potential neuroprotective mechanisms in females. In male mice, lower doses (5 and 10 &#956;g) led to a delayed reduction in striatal TH expression, primarily at day 14, while the highest dose (20 &#956;g) caused a progressive, severe decrease in dopaminergic fibers in the striatum. Both optical fractionation and mean fluorescence intensity reliably indicated TH + cell loss in the SNpc, validating the latter as an efficient alternative to stereological counting. We observed robust glial activation (CD68, Iba1, LAMP1, GFAP) in the striatum three days after 6-OHDA infusion, along with an upregulation of inflammatory markers in the SNpc that began within a day and primarily sustained for at least a week preceding morphological cell death. Additionally, we found that 20 &#956;g of 6-OHDA activated DAPK1 in the striatum, potentially promoting excitotoxicity, while GSK-3&#946; and AKT did not regulate pro-apoptotic signaling.</p><p id="P42">We demonstrated that the 6-OHDA lesion can be extensively characterized with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and quantitative 3D analysis of TH + neurons. Likewise, Roostalu, et al. observed a similar, albeit milder, pattern of TH loss after systemic injection of MPTP.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Our catecholaminergic mapping data aligns with the conventional WB and 2D quantification techniques used in this and other studies.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> For example, 6-OHDA decreased the density of TH + cells 51&#8211;52% in a singular cluster localized 89&#8211;95% to the SNpc, 4&#8211;9% to the VTA, and 1&#8211;2% to the supramammillary nucleus (SUM). Conversely, loss of TH + fibers was widespread, impacting the striatum, isocortex, midbrain, hippocampal formation, olfactory areas, and amygdalar nuclei. As TH + fiber loss spreads beyond regions with dopaminergic innervation&#8212;such as the striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate area<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, and rhinal cortices<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>&#8212;damage also affects noradrenergic projections. These projections extend widely across the brain, reaching areas including the isocortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum.</p><p id="P43">In contrast to the widespread TH + fiber loss, compensatory increases were spatially confined to a few subcortical regions, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pallidum, and lateral septal nucleus. Consistent with this, bilateral remodeling of efferents and afferents connected to the dopaminergic A13 cell group in the hypothalamus has been reported following a unilateral infusion of 6-OHDA (3.6 &#956;g) into the medial forebrain bundle, with mapping occurring 29 days later.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Although the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), dopaminergic A13 group, the nucleus of reuniens (RE), and pontine central gray (PCG) appeared to show compensatory increases in TH + cell density, this likely indicates enhanced TH expression and/or TH fiber density, leading to the heightened detection of TH + cells.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Interestingly, nuclei with noradrenergic neurons, such as the locus coeruleus (LC), were resistant to 6-OHDA toxicity.

However, further investigation is needed to explore the neuroprotective mechanisms in female mice that underlie their resilience against the 6-OHDA neurotoxin at the doses studied here.

The lowest dose (5 &#956;g) causes a gradual reduction in striatal TH + expression, which may not reach significance but still leads to SNpc neuron loss by day 14, indicating a milder injury, which could be easier to rescue. This makes it a sensitive readout for testing neurotherapeutics aimed at stabilizing pre-synaptic terminals or exploring striatal mechanisms, provided the studies are sufficiently powered. In contrast, the highest dose (20 &#956;g) rapidly reduces TH + neurons in the SNpc within 7 days, making it better suited for efficient screening of experimental therapies attempting to preserve cell bodies and slow rostrocaudal degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.

Here, we report a distinct chemokine/cytokine signature in the SNpc on days 1, 3, and 7 following 6-OHDA infusion. The robust upregulation of chemokines from 6-OHDA is likely driven by proinflammatory, activated microglia, which promote chemoattraction (e.g., via CCL5) of CD8 + T helper cells, eosinophils, and monocytes. In turn, chemokines such as MIP-1&#945;, MIP-1&#946;, and MIP-2 create a sustained positive feedback loop of proinflammatory microglial activation and proliferation.<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> IP-10/CXCL10 signaling leads to the activation of apoptotic pathways,<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> while upregulation of the cytokine BAFF/TNFSF13B, primarily released by B cells, aligns with evidence of B and T cell infiltration in the brains of 6-OHDA-infused mice.<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> This also explains the increase in RANTES/CCL5, predominantly related to T-cell infiltration.<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Our observation of a robust, rapid inflammatory response suggests early activation of microglia and astrocytes driven by damaged SNpc neurons.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Glial reactivity is further evidenced by the increased protein levels of CD68, Iba1, LAMP1, and GFAP in the striatum on day 3, although the mechanisms underlying activation at the infusion site may differ.

Traditional histopathological methods effectively detected dose-dependent, progressive striatal TH + fiber loss and SNpc neurodegeneration, while also revealing resilience in female mice. These findings were complemented by an innovative approach for quantifying brain-wide iDISCO+/LSFM data. Specifically, differential TH immunolabeling was spatially resolved through voxel-wise analyses and carefully evaluated with FDR correction and precise measurements of TH + cell and fiber densities in the most affected regions. This study also highlights the early immune response preceding neuronal cell death in the striatum and SNpc, revealing a distinct cytokine/chemokine signature to that observed in PD patients. Additionally, we identified increased DAPK1 activity, which may drive excitotoxicity in SNpc neurons. Our findings offer valuable insights into the 6-OHDA mouse model, delineating brain-wide histopathology and the biochemical signaling profile in the nigrostriatal pathway.
