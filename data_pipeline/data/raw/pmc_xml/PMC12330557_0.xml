Inflammation drives RD progression, and is regulated by the recruitment and reactivity of glia cells as well as through small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we explore the effects of treadmill exercise on the recruitment and reactivity of retinal inflammatory cells within the neural retina and miRNA expression in a light-induced retinal degeneration model (LIRD) that exhibits phenotypes found in patients with RD.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods:</title><p id="P3">Male 6-week-old BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to either active or inactive groups. Active groups were exercised by treadmill 1 hour a day for two weeks at a speed of 10m/min, meanwhile inactive groups were placed on static treadmills for the same duration. Light induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) was induced during the second week of exercise using light exposure of 5000 lux, control animals were kept at 50 lux. Retinal function was assessed using electroretinography (ERG) 5 days after LIRD. Retinas were collected 1-day and 5-days post-LIRD, sagittal sections were stained for inflammatory markers (GFAP and Iba1), TUNEL (cell death), and photoreceptor nuclei (outer nuclear layer; ONL) were quantified. RNA was extracted and miRNA expression quantified with GeneChip miRNA 4.0 array.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results:</title><p id="P4">Active+LIRD mice demonstrated significant preservation of retinal function, evidenced by higher a-wave and b-wave amplitudes in ERG 5-days post-LIRD, compared to inactive+LIRD mice. Retinal sections from active+LIRD mice had fewer Iba1+ cells and decreased GFAP labeling 5-days post-LIRD compared to inactive+LIRD mice. Active+LIRD mice had fewer ONL TUNEL+ cells compared to inactive+LIRD mice. Inactive+LIRD mice showed a decline in ONL counts 1-day post-LIRD with significant loss 5-days post-LIRD compared to active+LIRD mice. In active groups, exercise promoted significant differences in miRNA expression, such as miR-302b, miR-192&#8211;5p, miR-187 compared to inactive groups.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p id="P5">Our results indicate that treadmill exercise preserved photoreceptor density, slowed and or prevented apoptosis in the ONL, and decreased the presence/recruitment of inflammatory cells in the neural retina. Altered miRNA expression profiles in active groups are associated with cell survival (miR-302b), oxidative stress regulation (miR-192&#8211;5p) and photoreceptor homeostasis (miR-187). These results reveal how exercise alters the retinal inflammatory response over the course of 1-day to 5-days, providing insight into exercise-based therapies and treatments for RD and neuroinflammatory diseases.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Retinal Neuroprotection</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>Retinal inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P6">Physical exercise has been shown to be an effective, non-invasive approach to halt and potentially prevent neurodegenerative disease progression. Our research group and others have investigated the neuroprotective effects of exercise in many animal models of retinal degenerative diseases<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. We have shown exercise reduced retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) stress, reduced photoreceptor cell death, preserved retinal structure and function, increased retinal astrocyte plasticity and reduced the expression of proinflammatory chemokines keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">One of the major targets for managing degenerative diseases is modulating the inflammatory response associated with disease onset and progression. Neuroinflammation is a hallmark feature of retinal degenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Physical exercise has been shown to regulate fundamental inflammatory pathways through modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles, which result in dampening of the innate immune response<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The regulation of inflammatory response is partly mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which modulate the expression of genes involved in cytokine production, immune cell activation, and resolution of inflammation<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To investigate how exercise influences retinal inflammatory cell response, photoreceptor cell apoptosis, and miRNA expression we have incorporated the light-induced retinal degeneration model (LIRD). Through this model we are able to assess how retinal structure, function and molecular markers are altered in the initial onset of retinal degeneration by assessing 1-day post-LIRD as well as 5-days post-LIRD. LIRD is a powerful model that recapitulates several phenotypes associated with retinal degenerative diseases and allows the precise control of retinal degeneration onset and intensity<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. By incorporating this inducible model as well as examining 1- and 5-days post LIRD, we are able to directly measure changes in glial inflammatory response, layer-specific photoreceptor survival, and expression of regulatory miRNAs in mice retinas in response to forced treadmill exercise at specific neurodegeneration checkpoints.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Animals</title><p id="P9">All animal procedures were approved by the Atlanta VA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Adult BALB/c male mice were purchased from Charles River (8&#8211;10 weeks old; Wilmington, MA, USA) and housed under a 12:12 light: dark cycle. During the light cycle, light levels measured at the floor of the mouse cages ranged from 5 to 45 lux. Mice had access to standard mouse chow (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet 2918, Irradiated, Rockville, MD) and water ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="P10">Mice were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: inactive + dim (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 24), active + dim (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 24), inactive + LIRD (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 24), and active + LIRD (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 24). Active groups ran on a rodent treadmill once daily at 10 m per minute (m/min), 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Inactive groups were placed on a static treadmill for the same amount of time. On the day of LIRD, mice were exposed to toxic light within 30 min of the end of the treadmill session. Mice included in the 1-day post-LIRD timepoint were euthanized following their exercise regimen 24 hours following light damage. Mice utilized for the 5-day post-LIRD timepoint were given an additional week of treadmill running, electroretinography (ERG) was performed to assess retinal function. Following 2 final days of exercise, mice were exercised in a staggered fashion so that each mouse could be euthanized immediately after the end of the 1 h treadmill session. Mice were euthanized via CO<sub>2</sub> gas inhalation and secondary cervical dislocation, eyes were enucleated for retinal flat mounts and retinal astrocyte isolation.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Exercise regimen and light exposure</title><p id="P11">In accordance with previous studies, active mice ran 60 min per day between ZT3&#8211;5 on treadmills equipped with electric shock gratings (Exer-3/6; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA). Grating inactivated if the mice received 10 shocks in a single session. Before daily treadmill sessions began, the mice were trained for 5 to 10 min at a pace of 5 to 10 m/min for 2 consecutive days on the treadmill. The mice learned to maintain running within the first few days of treadmill exposure, receiving very few shocks after the first 1 to 2 days. Inactive mice were placed on static treadmills. Following 2 weeks of exercise, the mice were exposed to typical laboratory lighting (50 lux; dim) or toxic light (5000 lux; LIRD) for 4 h using a white light emitting diode (LED) light panel (LED500A; Fancierstudio, Hayward, CA, USA). This level of toxic light is a moderate brightness to induce retinal degeneration. For light exposure, animals were individually housed in shoebox containers with the LED light panel placed above as previously described<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Room and light box temperatures were closely monitored to ensure animal welfare. Following light damage, mice were exercised for an additional week and were euthanized 1-day and 5-days post-light exposure.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Electroretinography (ERG)</title><p id="P12">Retinal function was measured with a commercial electroretinography (ERG) system (Bigshot; LKC Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). After overnight dark adaptation, mice were anesthetized (ketamine [80 mg/kg]/xylazine [16 mg/kg]). All procedures were performed under dim red light during the subjective day. The pupils were dilated (1% tropicamide; Alcon Laboratories, Ft. Worth, TX) and corneas were anesthetized (1% tetracaine; Alcon Laboratories, Ft. Worth, TX). Body temperature was maintained with a heating pad at 37&#176;C (ATC 1000; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) for the duration of the session. The ERG protocol consisted of a ten-step series of full-field flash stimuli produced by a Ganzfeld dome under both dark-adapted scotopic conditions (&#8722;3.0 to 2.1 log cd s/m<sup>2</sup>) to test rod and rod/cone pathways and light-adapted photopic conditions to test cone pathway function (2.0 log cd s/m<sup>2</sup> presented as 6.1 Hz flicker with a 30 cd/m<sup>2</sup> background light). Custom gold-loop wire electrodes were placed on the center of each eye through a layer of 1% methylcellulose to measure the electrical response of the eye to each flash. Reference and ground platinum needle reference electrodes (1cm; Natus Medical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA) were inserted subcutaneously in cheeks and the tail, respectively. Once ERG was completed, mice were given an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of atipamezole (1 mg/kg; Antisedan, Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) to counteract the effects of xylazine, administered saline eye drops and allowed to recover on a heating pad (37&#176;C) before being returned to housing. ERG responses from both eyes were averaged.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Histology</title><p id="P13">Eyes enucleated for histological analysis and were fixed in 97% methanol/ 3% acetic acid, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned through the sagittal plane on a microtome (5&#956;m).

For immunofluorescence negative controls, retinal flat mounts from each experimental group were incubated with primary antibody diluent alone with no primary antibody, followed by incubation with secondary antibody to ensure staining was produced from the detection of the antigen by the primary antibody. Retinal sections were imaged using a Nikon A1R HD25 confocal microscope with a Plano Apo 20x NA 0.75 objective and compiled and quantified using ImageJ software.

Additionally, previous research in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease mouse models have shown that regular exercise reduces ocular NF-&#954;B-induced inflammation and upregulates molecular markers (FNDC5, PGC-1&#945;, and SIRT1) involved in mitochondria biogenesis and cell repair in the retina<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Similarly, aerobic exercise-induced brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression has also been shown to provide neuroprotective measures by stabilizing photoreceptor nuclei, promoting astrocyte plasticity and in axotomized optic nerve mouse models, salvaging damaged retinal ganglion cells<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. However, most notably, physical activity protects against neuronal apoptosis. For example, by suppressing pro-apoptotic proteins and enhancing the expression of cell survival factors through treadmill or running wheel exercise, an anti-apoptotic effect can be observed in rodent retinal cells<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Our study aims to add to these findings by investigating how exercise modulates cell death, inflammatory response, and miRNA expression and the inflammatory response for retinal neuroprotection 1-day and 5-days post LIRD.</p><p id="P23">This study finds that regular exercise promotes neuroprotective effects in mice with LIRD. After 2 weeks of 60-minute daily treadmill exercise, active+LIRD mice showed preserved photoreceptor density, decreased ONL cell apoptosis, suppression of inflammatory markers in retinal glial cells, and altered of miRNAs (miR-302b, miR-192&#8211;5p, miR-187) related to inflammatory responses, compared to inactive+LIRD mice 1-day and 5-days after LIRD. Our results provide support for exercise-based therapies to treat and provide protective, preventative measures against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammatory diseases.</p><p id="P24">Similar to our previous studies, electroretinography and TUNEL staining analyses revealed exercised mice had preservation of retinal cell function and a reduction in photoreceptor apoptosis compared to inactive+LIRD mice. We found 5-days post-LIRD, active+LIRD mice consistently showed significantly higher a- and a-wave amplitudes on electroretinogram graphs. Higher a- and b- wave amplitudes, a marker of the strength of rod photoreceptor cells&#8217; electrical signals, indicates exercise has a preservative effect on photoreceptor cell signaling in active+LIRD mice, even after induced damage. In contrast, a diminished a- and b-wave photoreceptor response in inactive+LIRD mice indicates a weakened photoreceptor response, and is consistent with our previously reported results, which are comparable to those with retinal degenerative disorders such as diabetic retinopathy<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Our experiments show that active+LIRD mice maintain functional a- wave amplitudes 1.98x the amplitudes of inactive+LIRD mice, and b- wave amplitudes 1.72x the amplitudes of the inactive+LIRD mice, suggesting preserved retinal function even after light-induced degeneration due to treadmill exercise.</p><p id="P25">Additionally, H&amp;E-stained sagittal sections and TUNEL analyses conducted 1-day and 5-days post-LIRD showed preserved photoreceptor nuclei in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in active+LIRD mice compared to inactive+LIRD mice. H&amp;E stains after LIRD shows that the mice who were treadmill-active had significantly less ONL nuclear degeneration throughout the retina than those who were not treadmill-active. This is supported by the fact that there was a significantly greater amount of apoptotic cells detected by TUNEL in the inactive+LIRD mice as opposed to the active+LIRD groups. It is important to note that although they still experienced nucleic degeneration from toxic light, active+LIRD mice still retained a significantly higher surviving cell density than the inactive+LIRD group. With a higher density of surviving photoreceptors and decreased quantity of photoreceptor apoptosis 1-day and 5-days post-LIRD exposure, active mice have noticeably healthier, preserved retinal layers in contrast to inactive mice.</p><p id="P26">Neuroprotective effects like those described above may be triggered by exercise&#8217;s anti-inflammatory benefits. It has been determined that retinal inflammation drives neurodegeneration, especially through the upregulation of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine pathways such as NF-&#954;B and members of the IL-1 family of pro-inflammatory interleukins by activated retinal microglia, macrophages, astrocytes, and Muller glial cells<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Accumulation of reactive microglia and astrocytes is characteristic of retinal inflammation-induced retinal pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), as well as typical aging<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. However, previous research indicates that exercise can mitigate the inflammatory response within the retina by reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression (KC and IP-10) involved with retinal vasculature as well as mitigating astrocyte morphology and gene expression<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In this study, we further explore the role of inflammatory markers through retinal glial cell recruitment and inflammation.</p><p id="P27">Although they are mainly known for providing structural and cellular support, astrocytes and Muller glia (collectively called macroglia) also play a role in the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines throughout the retinal layer<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. In mammalian cells, upregulation of chemokine release by Muller glia is correlated with retinal stress, damage, and disease, especially in inflammatory diseases like proliferative vitreoretinopathy<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> . However, they are also known to promote neuroprotection through the release of growth factors such as BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF), and Muller glia derived progenitor cells are still currently being studied for their neuroregenerative potential<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. For example, zebrafish and chick retinas have the potential to regenerate retinal neurons and glia by inducing stem cell-like properties in response to damage<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. In a similar supportive role, astrocytes are heavily involved in regulating inflammatory cascades and supporting survival and axonal regeneration after induced damage<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Because of their collective roles in the immune response, macroglia are often used as markers to quantify retinal condition after inflammation or damage.</p><p id="P28">In our study, we found that exercise partially suppresses the recruitment of pro-inflammatory, reactive macroglia 1-day and 5-days after light-induced damage (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">fig. 4</xref>). Active+LIRD mice showed a significant reduction in astrocyte and Muller glia labeling of astrocytes and Muller glia in the INL and IPL compared to inactive+LIRD mice, indicating that exercise may mitigate the activation of pro-inflammatory glia. In addition, Iba1+, a microglia and macrophage marker, was also less present in the ONL, IPL, and GCL in active+LIRD mice versus inactive+LIRD. This decreased inflammatory glial cell response in active+LIRD mice indicates that exercise plays a role in suppressing the detrimental inflammatory response, allowing for increased protection against inflammation-induced neurodegeneration.</p><p id="P29">MicroRNAs, or miRNAs, are also an important factor in regulating cells&#8217; inflammatory response<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. miRNAs are non-coding RNAs that primarily control gene expression in response to environmental influences and even help time retinal neurogenesis<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. In canine retinitis pigmentosa models, anti-apoptotic miRNAs have been found to be upregulated and pro-apoptotic miRNAs downregulated to potentially counteract retinal degeneration<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. In Muller glial cells, inflammation associated with diabetic retinopathy leads to the upregulation of certain immune-related genes, and other types of damage contribute to promoting oxidative stress and retinal inflammatory factor expression<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Our study further confirms the conclusion that miRNAs are a significant factor in determining retinal cell survival. We found that 1-day and 5-day post-LIRD combined with treadmill exercise significantly affects the expression of miR-192&#8211;5p and miR-187, which are involved in apoptosis and the retinal inflammatory response, while downregulating the expression of miR-302b, a miRNA involved in the progression of aging and inflammation. Even in control mice without light-induced retinal degeneration, changes in expression after exercise were observed in miRNAs involved in regulating angiogenesis and cell proliferation, both 1-day and 5-days post-LIRD.</p><p id="P30">In groups not treated with LIRD, mice were kept in a dim environment and randomly sorted into active or inactive groups for treadmill exercise. Between active+dim and inactive+dim groups 1-day post-LIRD, upregulation of miR-1224 was observed, a miRNA involved in suppressing glioma<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and improving post-stroke neuronal vasculature<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. miR-183&#8211;5p, a miRNA modulating retinal function, was also upregulated<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. In contrast, miR-17 and miR-320, anti-angiogenesis and anti-survival factors were downregulated<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. We found similar results 5-days post-LIRD. Tumor-suppressing and apoptotic genes<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>, miR-1298&#8211;5p and miR139 were upregulated in addition to retinal functionality gene miR-99b-5p<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> while miR-3065, a factor involved in stemness and colorectal cancer metastasis, was downregulated<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Taken together, it can be suggested that even without being affected with retinal degeneration, treadmill exercise provides neuroprotective effects by upregulating miRNAs involved in angiogenesis and tumor suppression, and downregulating miRNAs involved in cancer proliferation.</p><p id="P31">The function of miR-192&#8211;5p has been previously explored in diseases like cancer and digestive disorders, and play vastly different roles based on the affected system<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>.One study reported a significant reduction in miR-192&#8211;5p expression in retinal microvascular endothelial cells from diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>.It was found that overexpression of miR-192&#8211;5p helped suppress cognitive dysfunction in mice with depression and was correlated with greater endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in DR patients<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Studies conducted on other neurodegenerative diseases showed similar results, in which miR-192&#8211;5p expression was downregulated in patients with AMD<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. Upregulation of miR-192&#8211;5p has also been found to play a role in inhibiting metastatic potential of colon cancer by downregulating expression of Bcl-2, Zeb2 and VEGFA, factors that inhibit apoptosis and promote cell growth. Based on these cumulative results, it can be suggested that the miR-192&#8211;5p acts a as a modulator of vascular endothelial growth factor<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. In this study, we found there was significant upregulation of miR-192&#8211;5p in the active+LIRD group compared to the inactive+LIRD group. Essentially, in mouse models with light-induced retinal degeneration, forced treadmill exercise is correlated with upregulation of miRNAs involved in vascular endothelial growth factors in the retina, potentially counteracting neural degeneration through supportive angiogenesis<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">miR-187 is a microRNA also found to contribute to cell survival in the retina. Decreased expression of miR-187 has been reported to correlate with increased expression of Smad7, a protein involved in inducing apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells. Similarly, a deficit of miR-187 leads to oxidative stress-induced cellular apoptosis, and thus neurodegeneration <sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. In this experiment, we found that 1-day and 5-day active+LIRD mice displayed upregulation of miR-187 post-exercise routine, compared to inactive+LIRD mice. This increased miR-187 expression could contribute to neuroprotection by resisting apoptotic signals triggered by oxidative stress, suggesting treadmill exercise as a viable treatment for preventing excess neuronal death/degeneration.</p><p id="P33">Additionally, it is also important to note the downregulation of expression of miR-302b-5p in active+LIRD mice compared to the inactive+LIRD mice. miR-302b is part of the miR-302/367 cluster, a family of microRNAs involved in cell survival and pluripotency. Recently, this cluster has been highly studied for its role in cancer treatment, and it has been found that regulating the expression of this cluster can suppress the development of tumors and control growth/apoptosis signals<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>. Interestingly, miR-302b-5p seems to play a role in both tumor suppression and promoting proliferation. In a study on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, miR-302b was shown to downregulate expression of ErbB4, a tumor growth and metastatic factor, as well as induce apoptosis in cancer cells<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. In another study on human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs), miR-302b was analyzed under the context of protecting hADSCs from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation by downregulating <italic toggle="yes">CDKN1A</italic>/p21 (a cell cycle disruptor)<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. Taking into account the various regulatory functions of miR-302b, its role in retinal degeneration can be inferred. Because the downregulation of miR-302b-5p in active+LIRD mice correlates with increased cell survival in the context of this experiment, this data suggests that miR-302b-5p has a potential role in inhibiting apoptosis. By downregulating a factor that induces apoptosis in response to stress, cell survival is promoted, as we report in the active+LIRD animals through increased ONL counts and a decreased presence of TUNEL positive cells.</p><p id="P34">In this study, we demonstrate that treadmill exercise has a neuroprotective effect against retinal degeneration. Compared to inactive+LIRD mice at 1- and 5-day checkpoints, active+LIRD mice showed a significantly preserved density of retinal photoreceptors, slowed apoptosis in the ONL, decreased recruitment of inflammatory cells in the retinal layer, and modified expression of miR-192&#8211;5p, miR-187, and miR-302b to promote cell survival and growth. Even in mice not treated with LIRD, upregulation of neuroprotective miRNAs (miR-1224&#8211;5p, miR-183&#8211;5p, miR-1298&#8211;5p, miR139, miR-99b-5p) and downregulation of cancer-related miRNAs (miR-17, miR-320&#8211;5p, miR-3065) was observed between active+dim and inactive+dim groups. Our results align with published literature claiming that consistent lifelong physical activity is associated with better quality of late-life vision, as well as a later onset of vision-related disease, such as retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and AMD <sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. In addition to supporting previous scientific research, our study also finds novel connections between specific regulatory miRNAs and neuroprotection. This work highlights how physical exercise can either up- or down-regulate specific miRNAs that promote retinal neuroprotection. However, as the experiment was more short-term focused, the long-term effects of exercise on immunoregulation and miRNA modulation on the retina may need to be explored, as well asdifferences in regulation across retinal degenerative diseases. Future directions may include trying to find methods of exogenous incorporation of miRNA into the body to promote neuroprotection in lieu of exercise, or creating optimized strategies for physical activity-related therapies. Overall, this study finds evidence for the neuroprotective benefits of exercise, and lends support for exercise-based therapies to reduce retinal neurodegeneration, inflammation, and importantly, highlights differences in miRNA expression initially after retinal insult as well as 5-days post retinal damage.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Funding</title><p id="P35">This work was supported by the following: VA BLR&amp;D IK2BX005304, NIH P30EY006360, R01EY028859, R01EY028450, R01EY021592, Department of Veterans Affairs Research Career Scientist Award RX003134, VA RR&amp;D RX002806, RX001924, RX002342, Atlanta Veterans Education and Research (FAVER) Foundation, the Abraham J. and Phyllis Katz Foundation, and Challenge Grant (RPB, Inc.).</p><sec id="S23"><title>Support:</title><p id="P36">VA BLR&amp;D IK2BX005304, VA RR&amp;D C9246C, VA RRD IK6 RX003134, NIH R21 EY027005, NIH P30EY06360, The Challenge Grant (Research to Prevent Blindness), The Abraham J. &amp; Phyllis Katz Foundation, Atlanta Veterans Education and Research (FAVER) Foundation, European Union Horizon Europe research and innovation program under the Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie grant agreement No 101153901.</p></sec></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><p id="P88">Declarations</p><p id="P89">Ethics approval</p><p id="P90">All animal procedures were approved by the Atlanta VA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.</p></fn><fn id="FN3"><p id="P91"><underline>Commercial relationships:</underline> none</p></fn><fn id="FN4"><p id="P92">Consent for publication</p><p id="P93">Not applicable.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="FN5"><p id="P94">Competing interests</p><p id="P95">Not applicable.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S24"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="P37">miRNA data are available on GEO, accession number XXX.
