Using field electrophysiology and two-photon imaging in awake, behaving mice and acute brain slices (P11&#8211;19), we found that severe and recurrent seizure-like activity (induced by NMDA and 4-aminopyridine) resulted in widespread, long-lasting dendritic beading and spine loss in cortical and hippocampal neurons, with localization patterns distinct from those described in adults. Beads showed persistently high calcium levels and stopped the spread of dendritic calcium signals. Dendritic beads suppressed hippocampal evoked field potentials, followed by only partial recovery, and reduced hippocampal long-term potentiation. Clinically used hyperosmotic treatments (mannitol or hypertonic saline) reduced seizure-induced beading and restored dendritic signal propagation. These findings suggest that seizure-induced dendritic beading disrupts circuit function and synaptic plasticity and may contribute to cognitive deficits after early-life seizures.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40478-025-02123-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dendritic blebbing</kwd><kwd>Neonatal</kwd><kwd>Status epilepticus</kwd><kwd>Cognitive impairment</kwd><kwd>Early-life seizures</kwd><kwd>Brain development</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>American Epilepsy Society,United States</institution></funding-source><award-id>1066027</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Iowa Neuroscience Institute</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH/NINDS R01NS115800</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>HAWK-IDDRC</institution></funding-source><award-id>P50 HD103556</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Hyperexcitability during early brain development is often associated with cognitive deficits later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Cognitive impairment and intellectual disability (ID) are common in newborns who suffer severe and intractable seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Similarly, other excitotoxic insults, such as hemorrhagic strokes or hypoxic-ischemic insults during early development, result in significant cognitive impairments in humans and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. These cognitive dysfunctions are often attributed to brain lesions and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, clinical and experimental evidence also hint at cognitive defects without apparent lesions or substantial neuronal loss following early-life excitotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. There is a critical need to understand the impact of &#8220;non-lethal&#8221; forms of injury that induce long-term alterations in morphology, synaptic transmission, and network processing.</p><p id="Par3">One relatively unexplained &#8220;non-lethal&#8221; consequence of several brain insults is the varicose swelling (beading) of neuronal dendrites, often accompanied by the loss of dendritic spines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Dendritic beading occurs during various excitotoxic brain insults, including severe seizures, spreading depolarizations, and hypoxic-ischemic injury, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], primarily due to the excessive stimulation of NMDA and other glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Experimental evidence from adult mice suggests that dendritic beading is often a harbinger of neuronal injury, with beading appearing first in distal dendrites and then progressively in proximal segments, suggesting a continuous injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Furthermore, observations from human tissue and animal models of focal intractable epilepsy suggest that dendritic beading is also associated with a marked loss of spines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Hence, dendritic beading and the resultant spine loss could be catastrophic for normal circuit function and plasticity mechanisms, especially during early brain development, which may contribute to cognitive deficits. However, the precise changes in dendritic morphology induced by early developmental excitotoxicity and its effects on neural circuit function remain relatively unexplored.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we examined the morphological and functional effects of dendritic beading resulting from excitotoxicity during early brain development. Using multiphoton microscopy in transgenic mice with sparse neuronal expression of YFP and GCaMP6s, we imaged the effect of excitotoxic injury on dendritic morphology and stimulus-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at high spatiotemporal resolution. We also evaluated the impact of common clinical treatments for brain edema on beading-induced disruption of dendritic function. Next, we assessed the impact of early developmental excitotoxicity and the resulting dendritic beading on hippocampal synaptic plasticity, a physiological correlate of learning and memory. Our findings shed light on how non-lethal dendritic beading results in altered long-term potentiation, which may underlie cognitive deficits associated with disorders of neuronal hyperexcitability. Our results also highlight the importance of mitigating non-lethal dendritic injury as a potential avenue for improving dendritic signal transmission and hippocampal plasticity following early-life seizures and other excitotoxic insults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and study design</title><p id="Par5">All experiments were conducted on male and female mouse pups using a protocol approved by The University of Iowa's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All mice were housed in a temperature and humidity-controlled vivarium with free access to food and water, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. We used transgenic mice that sparsely express a genetically encoded stable yellow fluorophore in neurons (Thy1-YFP-H, Jax #003782) or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6s (Thy1-GCaMP6s/GP4.3, Jax #024275).

Experiments on acute brain slices were performed using male and female mouse pups (P11&#8211;13, n&#8201;=&#8201;33).

We investigated the role of common clinical hyperosmotic interventions (+&#8201;40&#160;mOsm of mannitol or hypertonic saline) in mitigating edema and, consequently, dendritic beading, during early brain development. Hyperosmotic conditions were applied during preincubation (10&#160;min before NMDA) or as treatments after NMDA application, which mimics a more clinical scenario, in Thy1-YFP acute brain slices (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A). We found that preincubation and treatment with mannitol or hypertonic saline mitigated NMDA-induced dendritic beading, with no significant difference in beading between hyperosmotic conditions and aCSF alone at 40&#160;min (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B, C). Matched analysis of each hyperosmotic condition demonstrated that NMDA-induced dendritic beading significantly decreased under both conditions at 40&#160;min but remained slightly higher than baseline (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D, E). Importantly, the proportion of beaded dendrites was significantly reduced at 40&#160;min under all hyperosmotic conditions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>F). As both mannitol and hypertonic saline decreased the number of dendritic beads, we chose to evaluate mannitol&#8217;s effects on dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Mannitol treatment significantly reduced the proportion of beaded dendrites expressing GCamP6s, similar to our findings with YFP-expressing dendrites (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G). Nevertheless, even with mannitol treatment, the dendrites that retained beads showed hindered Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation along their length (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>H, Video S4) and the mean amplitude of the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was still inversely correlated with bead density (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>I). However, by decreasing the number of beaded dendrites, mannitol indirectly restored the mean amplitude of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients compared to NMDA-treated slices (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>J).

Most clinical and experimental evidence for dendrotoxicity phenotypes comes from studies involving adults, while the morphological and functional nuances of excitotoxic dendritic beading during early development remain relatively unexplored. Our study demonstrates robust dendritic beading in neocortical and hippocampal neurons after brief NMDAR stimulation and recurrent seizures (status epilepticus) in acute brain slices and awake, behaving mice during early brain development (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We found a uniform spatial distribution of excitotoxic beading in the basal dendrites and the oblique branches or tufts of the apical dendrites (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Dendritic beading during early development was accompanied by dendritic spine loss in acute brain slices and in vivo (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We also found persistently high cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the dendritic varicosities and a propagation block of stimulus-evoked dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses due to the presence of the beads (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In the hippocampal network, we demonstrated that slices exposed to beading-inducing stimuli exhibited rapid suppression of evoked extracellular field potentials, a slow recovery, and impaired short- and long-term synaptic plasticity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Finally, different clinically relevant hyperosmotic interventions resolved excitotoxicity-induced dendritic beads and, as a result, facilitated the recovery of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Our results elucidate the phenotype of excitotoxic dendritic beading during early brain development and indicate that excitotoxicity-induced dendritic dysfunction may contribute to memory defects associated with prolonged and intense seizures.</p><p id="Par29">Previous studies have reported inconsistencies in dendritic beading, with the extent of beading likely depending on the duration or severity of excitotoxic insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Our approach, which involved severe and prolonged recurrent seizures modeled by brief NMDAR stimulation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and prolonged 4-AP treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E, I), produced reliable dendritic beading in neocortical and hippocampal slices of the developing brain, enabling their quantification and the evaluation of common clinical interventions. While it took longer for 4AP to induce statistically significant beading compared to NMDA perfusion, this is most likely due to the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx with NMDA, compared to the intermittent influx with 4-AP. Additionally, we demonstrated that brief NMDAR stimulation in awake, behaving young mice also induced robust dendritic beading (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A&#8211;D), consistent with other in vivo chemoconvulsant models where dendritic beading correlated to seizure severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although we used a high NMDA concentration (125&#160;&#181;M), this was necessary for the NMDA to penetrate the brain parenchyma through the intact dura mater. Additionally, although we used semi-automated methods for spine detection and our experiments were not blinded due to the evident neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and beading caused by NMDA and 4-AP, incorporating fully automated machine learning approaches in future research could further enhance rigor. Nevertheless, our models, which yielded robust and reproducible dendritic beading, enabled us to characterize this phenomenon in the developing brain.</p><p id="Par30">Adult mouse studies suggest that the influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through excessive glutamate receptor activation is necessary for the formation of dendritic beads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although we did not assess the necessity of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in early-life dendritic bead formation by altering extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, we observed persistently high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (GCaMP6s) signals within the dendritic beads. The dendritic bead densities also decreased after NMDA receptor antagonism, supporting adult mice results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionally, the influx of water and chloride through cation-chloride cotransporters and other transporters is necessary to induce dendritic beading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], similar to what is observed in neuronal somatic swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Compared to hypertonic saline, mannitol can reduce seizures by decreasing neuronal chloride accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, one might expect that hypertonic saline would exacerbate dendritic beading due to a greater gradient of sodium and chloride entering the dendrites, particularly since the canonical chloride (and sodium) importer NKCC1 is expressed at this age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, this was not the case as both mannitol and hypertonic saline decreased dendritic beading. Importantly, we observed similar effects whether the hyperosmotic therapies were administered before or after NMDA perfusion.</p><p id="Par31">We observed differences in how dendrites swell in response to excitotoxic injury between the developing and adult brains. Studies in adult hippocampal slices indicate that brief NMDAR stimulation induces beading in the basal dendrites and distal branches of apical dendrites, followed by delayed and progressive beading in the proximal sections of apical dendrites, along with persistent suppression of evoked hippocampal field potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In contrast, although applying the same brief NMDAR stimulation protocol on developing brain slices (P11&#8211;13) induced beading of distal and oblique branches and tufts, it did not lead to delayed, progressive beading in proximal apical dendrites up to 70&#160;min after NMDA (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Additionally, in contrast with adult brain slices, the suppressed evoked-field responses after NMDAR stimulation gradually recovered to about 50% of the baseline responses within 70&#160;min in a subset of slices from developing hippocampi (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These results may indicate different susceptibilities to &#8220;dendrotoxicity&#8221; induced by excessive glutamate receptor stimulation between acute brain slices from developing and adult brains.

Loss of mixed microtubule polarity in mature neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], along with the loss of MAP2 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], may contribute to increased susceptibility to apical dendrite beading. Also, microglial involvement in seizure-induced dendritic bead resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] suggests a potential difference in microglial responses to dendritic injury between adult and developing brains. However, the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown, and more research is needed to investigate the age-related vulnerability to dendritic beading, particularly in the apical dendrites.</p><p id="Par32">Early life exposure to prolonged seizures is linked to intellectual disabilities and cognitive impairments later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Excitotoxicity-induced dendritic beading results in a significant loss of dendritic spines. This loss has been observed in the neocortex and hippocampus of pathological specimens from both human epilepsy patients and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Similar findings have also been reported in other forms of brain excitotoxicity, including spreading depolarization, hypoxic-ischemic insults, and brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Dendritic spines serve as the anatomical loci for glutamatergic synaptic inputs onto neurons and are critical for the expression of synaptic plasticity and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The &#8220;critical period&#8221; for synaptic plasticity during early development is characterized by a prevalence of &#8220;silent&#8221; synapses with only NMDA receptors, which can encode information (unsilenced) after activity-dependent insertion of AMPA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Early developmental seizures can cause premature unsilencing of these synapses, thereby impairing activity-dependent plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Our results support an alternative mechanism: spine loss triggered by excitotoxicity or seizure-induced dendritic beading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] would mimic premature spine elimination, impairing synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. This process may serve as an additional pathological substrate, alongside dendritic beading, for memory deficits and other cognitive impairments associated with early-life seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, addressing dendritic beading and related spine loss may serve as therapeutic targets to prevent neurocognitive sequelae linked to early-life excitotoxicity.</p><p id="Par33">We observed persistently elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the dendritic beads. Typically, activity-dependent neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup>influx leads to only a transient rise in its concentration due to rapid uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and other extrusion mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is critical for preventing runaway excitation at dendritic spines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and may fail due to altered and prolonged mitochondrial depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. A co-occurrence of depolarized mitochondria has been observed in regions containing dendritic beads in cultured neurons, suggesting a potential mechanism for the persistently elevated localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in these areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We also found that dendritic beads suppress evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, as regions containing these beads hinder the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals along the dendritic segments. We hypothesize that this may result from abnormally high localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, resulting from persistent membrane depolarization, or altered extrusion or buffering mechanisms at dendritic beads. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown. Nonetheless, the outcome is altered dendritic transmission, which impacts signal processing.</p><p id="Par34">In summary, we demonstrated that long-lasting dendritic beading and spine loss following early-life excitotoxicity, including seizures, harm neural processing and synaptic plasticity in the developing brain. These dendritic changes, if not reversed, can lead to cognitive defects. Hypertonic treatment reverses a significant portion of dendritic beading. Future studies into the molecular mechanisms that mediate dendritic beading and related spine loss during early brain development could identify new therapeutic targets to prevent cognitive defects related to early-life excitotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
