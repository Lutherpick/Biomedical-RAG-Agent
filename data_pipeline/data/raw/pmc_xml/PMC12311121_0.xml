To advance the understanding of GBM and develop more effective therapies, preclinical studies commonly use mouse models due to their genetic and physiological similarities to humans. In particular, the GL261 mouse glioma model is employed for its reproducible tumor growth and ability to mimic key aspects of human gliomas. Ultrasound imaging is a valuable modality in preclinical studies, offering real-time, non-invasive tumor monitoring and facilitating treatment response assessment. Furthermore, its potential therapeutic applications, such as in tumor ablation, expand its utility in preclinical studies. However, real-time segmentation of GL261 tumors during surgery introduces significant complexities, such as precise tumor boundary delineation and maintaining processing efficiency. Automated segmentation offers a solution, but its success relies on high-quality datasets with precise labeling. Our study introduces the first publicly available ultrasound dataset specifically developed to improve tumor segmentation in GL261 glioblastomas, providing 1,856 annotated images to support AI model development in preclinical research. This dataset bridges preclinical insights and clinical practice, laying the foundation for developing more accurate and effective tumor resection techniques.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer imaging</kwd><kwd>Preclinical research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background &amp; Summary</title><p id="Par2">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive primary brain tumor, with a dismal prognosis and roughly 12 000 new cases diagnosed each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Despite decades of research, overall survival for high-grade gliomas (WHO grades III&#8211;IV) has changed little. Major challenges include marked inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity, microscopic invasion and the difficulty of delineating tumor margins during surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. GBM is typified by profound intratumoural heterogeneity and immune evasion, driven by oncogenic processes such as aberrant growth-factor signalling, dysregulated cell-cycle control, pathological angiogenesis, invasive migration, genomic instability and defects in apoptotic pathways. Histopathologically, it shows diffuse astrocytic infiltration, pseudopalisading necrosis, extensive microvascular proliferation and high mitotic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">For diagnosing GBM, a range of advanced clinical imaging techniques is utilized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), often enhanced with contrast agents, improves diagnostic clarity. Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans also provide information about tumor size and location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The latest guidelines from the European Association for Neuro-Oncology (EANO) and the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) recommend a multimodal standard-of-care: maximal safe resection followed by concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide, then adjuvant temozolomide. Molecular profiling (e.g., MGMT promoter methylation, IDH mutation status) is used to guide prognosis and determine clinical trial eligibility. For recurrent disease, selective re-irradiation is advised when feasible. Additionally, emerging modalities&#8212;such as tumor-treating fields, immune checkpoint inhibitors, personalized vaccines, and oncolytic viral therapies&#8212;are increasingly incorporated through clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Despite aggressive treatment, GBM often recurs due to microscopic residual tumor cells that remain in the surrounding brain tissue. Enhanced visualization of these residual cells could facilitate more precise interventions and monitoring, potentially reducing recurrence and improving patient outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Ultrasound is another modality frequently used to deliver real-time, non-invasive imaging of soft tissues and to monitor therapeutic outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. During GBM preclinical studies, ultrasound imaging can help distinguish tumor tissue from healthy brain tissue by detecting differences in acoustic properties. These variations produce distinct signal patterns, enabling real-time visualization of tumor margins for more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Meta-analyses show that intraoperative ultrasound helps reduce residual tumor in GBM surgery by clearly visualizing tumor margins. Its real-time imaging supports more informed decisions and improves surgical precision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition to its imaging capabilities, ultrasound is being explored for therapeutic uses, especially in non-invasive or minimally invasive treatments like focused ultrasound for targeted drug delivery, disrupting the blood-brain barrier, and tumor ablation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Among the various therapeutic ultrasound methods, one promising approach is histotripsy, which has gained attention for its potential to target and ablate tumors precisely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Histotripsy is a non-thermal ultrasound technique that uses short, focused high-pressure pulses to destroy tumor tissue through cavitation bubbles. It shows promise as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery and other ablation methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Ongoing pre-clinical studies have also demonstrated that histotripsy can trigger a strong immune response by releasing tumor antigens during the destruction of cancer cells. These antigens stimulate the immune system, helping it recognize and attack any residual tumor cells. This immune activation could also enhance the overall effectiveness of the treatment by reducing the likelihood of tumor recurrences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The GL261 glioma cell line is commonly used in glioblastoma research for its ability to mimic the aggressive nature of human GBM. It enables studies on tumor growth and treatment response. Histotripsy has been applied to GL261 tumors in mice, showing promising potential for advancing cancer therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In these studies, precise tumor delineation is essential for effective histotripsy. By clearly defining the tumor boundaries, histotripsy can accurately target the cancerous tissue, sparing surrounding healthy areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. GL261 tumor segmentation has conventionally been performed manually using MRI scans, where tumor boundaries are identified and delineated directly from the imaging data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Machine learning (ML) refers to a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses algorithms and statistical models to identify patterns and make predictions based on data. Automatic detection, segmentation, and classification of tumors are among important applications of ML models in clinical settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These models can handle different imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, and ultrasound.</p><p id="Par7">The number of studies utilizing ML models for automated tumor delineation has steadily increased, with many demonstrating substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over manual methods. For example, Weng <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> conducted a multicenter study to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of AI-based automatic segmentation of rodent brain tumors on MRI. Utilizing a 3D U-Net architecture, the study achieved accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI images from 57 WAG/Rij rats and 46 mice. Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> developed TumorPrism3D, a software tool designed for AI-assisted segmentation of brain tumors in MR images. The study tested the software on MRI data from 185 GBM patients, focusing on segmenting contrast-enhancing lesions, necrotic regions, and non-enhancing T2 high signal intensity components. TumorPrism3D demonstrated high accuracy in segmenting these tumor components, proving effective in facilitating the analysis of brain tumors in MRI scans. Di Ieva <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of a machine learning model for the automatic segmentation of brain tumors on MRI, particularly for clinical applications such as radiosurgery planning. The model was trained on the Medical Decathlon dataset and tested on the BraTS 2019 glioma dataset. The study demonstrated that the model accurately segmented brain tumors using various MRI sequences and could generalize well to non-glioma cases through transfer learning.</p><p id="Par8">Our group&#8217;s overarching goal is to use histotripsy to ablate the entire volume of a GL261-transplanted mouse brain tumor using a device under automated robotic arm control. This approach aims to enhance ablation accuracy and precision while reducing procedure time. To achieve this, we first need to delineate the GBM boundary. In pursuit of this larger goal, we began by collecting the first ultrasound datasets of mice with GL261 tumors using a custom-built imaging system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> capable of performing both histotripsy and high-resolution ultrasound imaging. After collecting ultrasound images of the brains of ten <italic toggle="yes">in-vivo</italic> mice (5 tumor-bearing and 5 non-tumorous) and two <italic toggle="yes">ex-vivo</italic> mice (tumor-bearing), the dataset was annotated by a group of five trained students and verified by two experienced professionals in the field. The Dice score, used for segmentation evaluation, measures the overlap between two data sets, which is commonly applied in image segmentation problems. A higher Dice score indicates a greater degree of overlap, thus reflecting the quality and accuracy of the segmentations. This metric ensures the reliability of the dataset and confirms the consistency of the annotations between both groups. Also, to ensure the highest quality of annotation, the corresponding MRI and histology images, when available, were also considered during the annotation process.</p><p id="Par9">The dataset is intended to train machine learning models to accurately segment tumor boundaries&#8212;a task that remains challenging during surgery. A total of 1,856 ultrasound images were collected, including 1,448 tumor images and 408 non-tumor images. This study aims to enhance surgical outcomes and reduce the time and costs associated with tumor boundary identification, thereby laying the groundwork for improved GBM surgeries in humans. Additionally, the dataset serves as a bridge between preclinical research and clinical application, supporting more precise tumor resections in both experimental models and future clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par10">Eleven female and one male C57BL/6 mice (~6 weeks old, weight range 22&#8211;25.5&#8201;g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and housed in clean, ventilated cages.

The AP and DV axes are measured relative to the skull reference point, Bregma, with negative AP values indicating a posterior position (toward the back) and positive values indicating an anterior position (toward the front). The ML axis measures the lateral distance from the midline of the brain, where positive values represent positions to the right and negative values to the left. The DV axis represents the vertical depth, with negative values indicating positions deeper within the brain tissue.

(&#8776;50,000 cells) was injected at 0.1&#8201;&#181;l/min. The incision was then sutured and lidocaine applied for local pain relief. Post-op, mice received mash, recovery gel, and water and were watched until fully mobile. At 24&#8201;h, they were given meloxicam in 0.5&#8201;ml saline subcutaneously, underwent a clinical exam and weight check, and had daily cage-side observations. Analgesics, fluids, gel, and mash were provided as needed thereafter. Weekly clinical exams continued until study endpoints; incisions were checked daily and sutures removed on days 7&#8211;10.</p><p id="Par13">Starting from the fifth-day post-operation, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and tumor growth was measured every five days by MRI scan. Imaging was performed using a 3&#8201;T MRI system with a 21&#8201;cm inner diameter gradient coil and a Varian direct drive console. The RF coil used was a 30&#8201;mm quadrature transmit/receive coil, optimized for small animal imaging. The T<sub>2</sub>-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) protocol employed a 64&#8201;&#215;&#8201;64 matrix, a 17&#8201;&#215;&#8201;17&#8201;mm field of view, and 20 slices of 0.7&#8201;mm thickness. When the tumor reached 2&#8211;3&#8201;mm, mice were prepared for terminal procedures within two days. Under isoflurane anesthesia, the head was secured in a stereotaxic frame, a scalp incision was made, and an 8&#8201;mm craniectomy centered on the injection site exposed the brain and dura. Ultrasound gel was applied, and tumor imaging was performed.</p><p id="Par14">For image collection, the probe was positioned above the tumor site, imaging through the craniectomy opening (details of the imaging system are given below). Ultrasound imaging was conducted from multiple angles and across various brain slices to capture a broad range of perspectives. In addition to the tumor-bearing mice, non-tumor mice were included in the study to provide control images for comparison. Histotripsy was also performed in some mice for a related study outside the scope of this article, which limited the availability of untreated tissue histology in some animals. After imaging, mice were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (150&#8201;mg/kg i.p.) and perfused with 10% formalin. Brains were fixed overnight, soaked in 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT, and cut coronally at 15&#8201;&#181;m. Sections were H&amp;E stained and scanned at 20&#215; magnification.</p><p id="Par15">During histological processing, occasional artifacts affected section quality. Slight, uneven shrinkage during fixation and sucrose infiltration caused minor contractions in section dimensions, and rapid freezing in OCT sometimes introduced localized stresses that made a few slices curve or cup rather than lie flat. Mechanical shear at the cryostat blade edge could generate micro-tears or gentle folds in regions of varying tissue density, and human error during sectioning occasionally distorted or partly removed the region of interest (ROI). Although most sections remained usable, these sporadic deformations shifted anatomical landmarks and complicated precise alignment with the ultrasound and MRI datasets. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> displays a high-resolution ultrasound image alongside the corresponding histological section of the same tissue and MRI. This pairing highlight how detailed structural features captured in the ultrasound correlate with the microscopic anatomy revealed through histology and MRI imaging, especially the tumor.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) H&amp;E image, and (<bold>b</bold>) MRI with corresponding (<bold>c</bold>) high-quality ultrasound image (<bold>d</bold>) brain surface and tumor outlines for each modality, showing very good agreement in tumor boundary position.

To enable a semi-quantitative assessment of spatial concordance across ultrasound, MRI, and H&amp;E, tumor boundaries and key anatomical landmarks&#8212;such as the cortical surface, striatal boundary, and visible tumor margins&#8212;were first defined independently in each modality. The spatial scale of each dataset was then adjusted to ensure consistent units, allowing meaningful spatial comparison. Using the identified landmarks, a spatial transform was computed to align the ultrasound images with the MRI and H&amp;E datasets. This transform was subsequently applied to the entire ultrasound image to bring its anatomy into approximate alignment with the other modalities.</p><p id="Par17">Although perfect co-registration is limited by intrinsic differences in acquisition technique, image resolution, and deformation artifacts introduced during histological, close spatial correspondence was achieved in most cases. For tumor delineation in ultrasound, an averaged boundary was derived from the partially aligned contours to accommodate minor discrepancies and provide a consistent segmentation reference. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(d)</xref>, black arrows indicate regions where tumor boundaries from ultrasound, MRI, and H&amp;E are closely aligned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Image acquisition</title><p id="Par18">Ultrasound imaging was conducted using a custom-built beamformer. The detailed specifications of the hardware, construction methods, and imaging system processing techniques are extensively covered in prior publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Here, only a brief overview is provided. The system featured a 64-element phased array with an element pitch of 48&#8201;&#181;m and an elevation length of 2&#8201;mm. The elements were defined by laser micro-machining a raw PIN-PMN-PT single crystal piezoelectric substrate. Aluminum wire bonds were used to connect the array elements to a cable interconnect PCB and then subsequently potted with an insulating epoxy. A 21&#8201;&#181;m thick parylene-C acoustic matching layer was vacuum deposited over the array and then a polyurethane lens was cast for focusing the elevation dimension to a 7&#8201;mm depth. The center frequency of the pulse was 30&#8201;MHz, and the probe could easily be co-aligned with a therapeutic histotripsy device with a small hole in the center. The FPGA-based imaging system provided clear images with axial and lateral resolutions of 40&#8201;&#181;m and 130&#8201;&#181;m, respectively, covering a 2&#8211;15&#8201;mm depth range, 128-line angles, and a 64&#176; sector range. Processed image data was displayed using the Sagacity software platform, developed in collaboration with Daxsonics Ultrasound Inc. (Halifax, Canada), which facilitated both raw data acquisition and proprietary enhanced image processing.</p><p id="Par19">Although the beamformer generated high-resolution images with minimal electronic noise, occasional artifacts were observed. Speckle noise, resulting from scattering by microscopic tissue structures, sometimes reduced contrast at the tumor margins, making accurate delineation more difficult in certain frames. Hemorrhagic signals, appearing as hyperechoic streaks or patches due to the presence of extravasated blood cells or small gas bubbles, occasionally resembled solid tissue and may obscure the true tumor edge. Other common artifacts were grating lobes, where bright structures such as bone, even when out of frame, can cause blurry streaks to appear on the opposite side of the image; and reverberation artifacts, where ultrasound waves reflected multiple times between the probe and a structure, producing faint duplicate images at greater depths.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Image annotation</title><p id="Par20">The annotation team comprised two experienced professionals and five students. Prior to initiating annotation tasks, the team underwent thorough training, which included in-depth familiarization with the GL261 mouse tumor models and key technical aspects of ultrasound imaging for accurate data interpretation. This training was delivered through a combination of online sessions and in-person guidance by the experts. During the annotation training process, any annotations that did not meet the required standards were returned to the respective student for further refinement. Annotators used custom-developed software programmed in the Python programming language that was designed for precise pixel-wise closed shape segmentation. This software has been made publicly available on Figshare for reproducibility and broader access. A total of 1,856 ultrasound images were collected from a mouse tumor injected with GL261, including 1,448 tumor images and 408 non-tumor images. The final segmentation was represented in a binary format, with tumor regions depicted in white and non-tumor areas in black. During the official annotation phase, each image was annotated by five annotators, and any overlapping pixels were reviewed for consistency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data Records</title><p id="Par21">All data records are available on Figshare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

All files are provided in PNG format, with image dimensions of 780&#8201;&#215;&#8201;900&#8201;mm/pixel, 16-bit unsigned integer bit depth, and little-endian byte order.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Technical Validation</title><p id="Par22">In this study, the ultrasound images underwent multiple rounds of annotation to ensure accuracy and consistency. Initially, each image was annotated five times by different annotators. The resulting segmentations were then averaged to create a mean segmentation, which was further refined by professional experts to establish a more precise ground truth. To validate the accuracy of these annotations, corresponding histology and MRI images were used where available, ensuring that the segmentations aligned with the actual tumor boundaries observed in these modalities, allowing for some discrepancy due to differences in exact slice position, and in the case of comparing MRI to ultrasound and histology, the tissue distortion that occurs after opening the skull.</p><p id="Par23">To assess the consistency and reliability of the annotations, a subset of 30 images was randomly selected from the full dataset for validation. Selection was stratified to ensure that the subset spanned the entire observed range of tumor diameters (2.2&#8211;5.0&#8201;mm), thereby including small, medium, and large lesions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This stratified sampling allowed us to evaluate annotation performance across diverse tumor presentations and ensured that the Dice-based validation reflected the dataset&#8217;s full morphological variability. The Dice coefficient, a measure of overlap between two segmentations ranging from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap), was calculated by comparing the mean of these segmentations to the annotations made by two professional experts. This process allowed for the evaluation of both intra-annotator and inter-annotator consistency. The mean Dice coefficient for the 30 images, comparing the students&#8217; mean segmentations to the expert annotations, was 88&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.05 for the first professional expert and 90&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.07 for the second professional expert. These results demonstrate the stability and consistency of the annotations across different annotators and time points, confirming the dataset&#8217;s reliability for further research and analysis.
